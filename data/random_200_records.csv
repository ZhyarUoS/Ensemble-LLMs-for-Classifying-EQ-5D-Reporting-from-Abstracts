179,Correlation between disease severity factors and EQ-5D utilities in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive/physiopathology; Quality of Life/psychology; CAT; COPD; EQ-5D; Health-Related Quality of Life","PURPOSE: Impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) is associated with poor health outcomes in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The aim of this study was to determine health utilities in patients with COPD and to identify the variables with the greatest impact. METHODS: This is a pooled analysis of data from 4 observational studies performed in stable COPD patients. Evaluation of patient HRQoL utilities was performed using the Spanish version of the self-administered EuroQoL 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire. EQ-5D utilities were described and compared according to several markers of disease severity RESULTS: 6198 patients reported a mean (SD) EQ-5D index of 0.67 (0.26). A linear dose response relationship between EQ-5D utility and modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) score, forced expiratory volume in one 1 s (% predicted), COPD hospital admissions in the previous year, self-reported daily walking time, Charlson index, body mass index, obstruction, dyspnoea and exacerbation (BODEx) index, COPD assessment test (CAT), hospital anxiety and depression scale was observed (p for trend < 0.001). In multivariate analysis, patients reporting lower utility values were those with more dyspnoea, more comorbidities, using long-term oxygen therapy, with previous hospitalisations due to a COPD exacerbation and higher (worse) CAT score. CONCLUSION: HRQoL measures such as EQ-5D can assist clinicians to understand the impact of respiratory disease on COPD patients",10.1007/s11136-019-02340-4
13783,Long-term outcomes of colectomy surgery among patients with ulcerative colitis,"Colectomy; Quality of life, pouchitis/pouch failure; Survey; Ulcerative colitis","The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term health-related quality of life outcomes among patients who had a colectomy within the previous 10 years. A cross-sectional survey was administered to consecutive patients ≥18 years of age with ulcerative colitis who had a colectomy within the last 10 years from centers in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. Data were extracted from medical chart reviews to confirm selected self-reported patient characteristics. Of 351 survey respondents, 49 % were male and the median age was 40 years (interquartile range 30-52). Respondents were diagnosed with UC a median of 9.2 (5.7-15.1) years prior to the survey and first surgery occurred a median of 3.7 (2.1-5.8) years ago. Although most respondents (84 %) reported improved quality of life compared to the status before surgery, 81 % experienced problems in at least one of the following areas: depression, work productivity, restrictions in diet, body image, and sexual function. According to HADS scores, 30 and 17 % of survey respondents experienced anxiety and depression, respectively. Among moderate to severe UC patients pre-colectomy, 27 % of men and 28 % of women reported that their sexual life was worse now than before surgery. The mean EQ-5D utility index score overall was 0.79 (95 % confidence interval 0.77-0.81). Quality of life after colectomy for UC is generally good, but there are persistent quality of life issues that impact multiple domains, including psychological and sexual functioning",10.1186/s40064-015-1350-7
2615,Association of neuropathic-like pain characteristics with clinical and radiographic features in patients with ankylosing spondylitis,"Adult; Aged; Back Pain/etiology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neuralgia/etiology; Pain Measurement; Prospective Studies; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Quality of Life; Radiography; Republic of Korea; Severity of Illness Index; Spondylitis, Ankylosing/complications/diagnostic imaging; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; Ankylosing spondylitis; Depression; Enthesitis; Neuropathic pain; mSASSS; painDETECT questionnaire","Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a chronic, progressive, and inflammatory disorder and causes chronic back pain. It is not unusual for patients with AS to have symptoms similar to neuropathic pain. We aimed to investigate the neuropathic pain (NeP) component in patients with AS using the painDETECT questionnaire (PD-Q) and to assess the relation between NeP and the disease characteristics of AS. A single-center prospective study was performed, including 105 patients Patients with AS completed three questionnaires: PD-Q, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Euro Quality of Life (EQ-5D) questionnaires. Patients were classified into three groups according to the PD-Q scores: nociceptive pain (NoP) (score ≤ 12), mixed pain (MP) (score 13-18), and NeP pain (score ≥ 19). Fifteen patients (14.2%) were classified into the NeP group, 22 (21.0%) in the MP group, and 68 (64.8%) in the NoP group. The questionnaires and clinical and radiographic findings were analyzed. Patients with NeP and MP scored worse on the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI); BDI; modified Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score; pain-visual analog scale (VAS); and EQ-5L index and showed an increased prevalence of enthesitis and peripheral arthritis There were no differences in objective inflammatory markers. PD-Q scores were positively correlated with pain-VAS, BASDAI, BDI, and inversely correlated with EQ-5D index. Age, BASDAI, presence of current enthesitis, and BDI score were independently associated with PD-Q scores. The findings showed that NeP component in AS was associated with age, high disease activity, presence of current enthesitis, and depression",10.1007/s10067-018-4125-z

AIMS: To assess the appropriateness of using the EQ-5D to measure improvements in mental health METHOD: Seventy-seven participants with psychosis were rated according to the EQ-5D and seven measures of mental health at both pre- and post-intervention. To assess construct validity we compared the (pre-intervention) mean EQ-5D scores for those with milder and more severe scores, according to each of the seven measures. To assess responsiveness we estimated the mean EQ-5D change score for those who improved (post-intervention), according to each of the measures RESULTS: The mean EQ-5D score was more favourable for both those with milder scores (mean difference: 0.044 to 0.301) and for those who improved post-intervention (mean change: 0.029 to 0.117). CONCLUSIONS: This suggests the EQ-5D should be considered for use in future cost-effectiveness studies in the area of mental health",10.1192/bjp.bp.108.057380
1177,Effectiveness of telemedicine for cardiovascular disease management: systematic review and meta-analysis,"Chronic Disease; Humans; Mental Health; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Telemedicine; Telemedicine; cardiovascular disease (CVD); health management","BACKGROUND: With the development of information communication technology (ICT), telemedicine has become a promising option for patients with chronic diseases who need continuous monitoring at home or in remote health care facilities. As cardiovascular disease (CVD) is responsible for an estimated 17.9 million deaths globally each year, it is appropriate to evaluate the effectiveness of telemedicine for the health care management of CVD patients. METHODS: The Library of Congress, LISTA (EBSCO), PubMed (NLM), and Web of Science databases were searched with a date limitation from 1 January 2000 until 5 August 2021 for Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) studies. Two independent researchers screened the records for inclusion and extracted the data for synthesis, supported by RevMan 5.0 software. As one of the clinical outcomes, the mean difference and standard deviation of systolic blood pressure were synthesized. For the Quality-of-life measures, EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) scores were also synthesized and for the depression level, CESD-10 scores were synthesized. RESULTS: We identified 23 studies for qualitative analysis and 21 studies for quantitative analysis. 21 studies included systolic blood pressure as an outcome measure and the results show a statistical difference (P<0.05) between the intervention group and the control group and a favorable inclination toward the Telemedicine enhanced health care program over the usual care. Of the six studies that included body mass index (BMI) as an outcome measure, there was no significant difference in BMI between the telemedicine and usual health care groups. A total of five studies assessed patients' quality of life using the EQ-5D instrument. After excluding one study following the sensitivity analysis, telemedicine was shown to significantly improve patients' quality of life. Three studies that investigated patients' mental health (CSE-D-10) also showed a significantly beneficial effect of telemedicine over usual health care. DISCUSSION: This review found limited evidence to support some of the outcomes in the original study designs. Overall, our findings suggested a favorable effect of telemedicine intervention in the field of health care for CVD patients. Due to the unavoidable heterogeneity within the selected literature, a more detailed investigation and analysis of the unclear outcomes is recommended",10.21037/apm-21-3626

Long-term consequence is disabling joint pain, stiffness, muscle weakness, atrophy and reduced mobility. The purpose of this proposed feasibility of a randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to test the feasibility of an age-appropriate physiotherapy intervention designed to improve muscle strength, posture and the way boys use their joints during walking and everyday activities. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A small-scale two-centre RCT of a 12-week muscle strengthening exercise intervention versus usual care for young children with haemophilia will be conducted. Primary outcomes will be safety and adherence to the exercise intervention. Secondary outcomes will include recruitment, retention and adverse event rates, clinical data, muscle strength, joint biomechanics and foot loading patterns during walking, 6 min timed walk, timed-up-and-down-stairs, EQ-5D-Y, participants' perceptions of the study, training requirements and relevant costs Recruitment, follow-up, safety and adherence rates will be described as percentages. Participant diary and interview data will be analysed using a framework analysis. Demographic and disease variable distributions will be analysed for descriptive purposes and covariant analysis. Estimates of differences between treatment arms (adjusted for baseline) and 75% and 95% CIs will be calculated. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has ethical approval from the London-Fulham Research Ethics Committee (17/LO/2043) as well as Health Research Authority approval. As well as informing the design of the definitive trial, results of this study will be presented at local, national and international physiotherapy and haemophilia meetings as well as manuscripts submitted to peer-reviewed journals. We will also share the main findings of the study to all participants and the Haemophilia Society",10.1136/bmjopen-2019-029474

The objective of this study is to analyze whether the symptoms that influence HRQoL are similar in women and men Data were part of the Pattern study, an international observational investigation which collected data from 1379 outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients were evaluated with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Inventory, the Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia, and the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and reported their quality of life using the Schizophrenia Quality of Life Scale (SQLS), the Short Form-36 (SF-36), and the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D). Men reported higher HRQoL on all scales. PANSS total score was 80.6 (SD 23.6) for women and 77.9 (SD 22.1) for men. In women, a higher PANSS negative score and a higher PANSS affective score were associated with a lower SQLS score In men, a higher PANSS positive score and a higher PANSS affective score were associated with a lower SQLS score. The same pattern appeared with EQ-VAS and EQ-5D tariff. In women, greater age and higher PANSS affective score were associated with a lower SF-36 mental component score. In men, higher PANSS affective, positive, and cognitive scores were associated with a lower SF-36 mental component score. This study shows that HRQoL is influenced by different psychiatric symptoms in women and men. This may have significant implications when deciding the main treatment target in patients with schizophrenia.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01634542",10.1007/s00737-018-0896-0

SISTERS (Spasticity In Stroke-Randomized Study) was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multicenter, phase 4 study to evaluate ITB therapy versus conventional medical management (CMM) with oral antispastic medications for treatment of poststroke spasticity Methods- Poststroke patients with spasticity in ≥2 extremities and an Ashworth Scale score of ≥3 in ≥2 affected lower extremity muscle groups were randomized (1:1) to ITB (N=31) or CMM (N=29). Both treatment arms received physiotherapy throughout. The primary outcome was the change in average Ashworth Scale score in the lower extremities of the affected side from baseline to month 6. Here, we report results for secondary outcomes: pain via the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, health-related QoL by the EuroQol-5 dimensional 3 level utility score and health status visual analog scale score, stroke-specific QoL, and patient satisfaction Analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis. Results- We observed significant treatment effects in favor of ITB over CMM for changes from baseline to month 6 in Numeric Pain Rating Scale scores for actual pain (ITB versus CMM: mean, -1.17 [SD, 3.17] versus 0.00 [3.29]; median, -1.00 versus 0.00; P=0.0380) and least pain (mean, -1.61 [2.29] versus 0.24 [3.07]; median, -1.00 versus 0.00; P=0.0136), and EuroQol-5 dimensional 3 level utility scores (mean, +0.09 [0.26] versus +0.01 [0.16]; median, +0.07 versus 0.00; P=0.0197). Between-group differences were not statistically significant for EuroQol-5 dimensional 3 level visual analog scale, stroke-specific QoL summary, or Numeric Pain Rating Scale worst pain scores, although ITB patients showed greater numeric improvements from baseline during follow-up. More ITB patients than CMM patients (73% versus 48%) were satisfied with the spasticity reduction at month 6. Conclusions- These data support that ITB therapy is associated with improvements in pain and QoL in poststroke patients. Clinical Trial Registration- URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov .

The aim of our study was to estimate HRQoL in SSc patients treated with two different intravenous (IV) iloprost (ILO) regimens and in patients not treated with IV ILO. 96 consecutive SSc patients were enrolled in a pragmatic, prospective and non-randomized study, and divided into 3 groups: not requiring therapy with IV ILO (N=52), IV ILO once monthly (N=24) or IV ILO for 5 consecutive days every 3 months (N=20). Patients were followed up for three months. We assessed HRQoL using the generic preference-based questionnaire EQ-5D-5L. We conducted multiple regression analyses to estimate, in each treatment group, the mean general health (GH) and the mean utility index of the EQ-5D-5L, adjusting for possible confounders. The mean adjusted utility index and GH score, after three months' follow-up, were not different in the three groups: IV ILO was able to make patients requiring IV ILO similar to those not requiring it. Moreover, there was no difference in this model between the two ILO regimens (1 day monthly vs 5 consecutive days every 3 months). The two different IV ILO regimens (the most appropriate regimen was decided according to patients' characteristics and needs) were able to stabilize HRQoL in RP secondary to SSc non-adequately controlled by oral therapy",10.4081/reumatismo.2019.1190

The service ran between February and December 2017. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of the service on patient activation, as measured by the PAM measure (primary outcome). Secondary outcomes included quality of life (EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS), medication adherence (MARS-5), NHS resource use and costs, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HDL cholesterol ratio levels and body mass index (BMI). A before and after design was used, with follow-up at 6-months. A questionnaire was distributed at follow-up and telephone interviews with willing participants were used to investigate patient satisfaction with the service. The study was approved by the University of Manchester Research Ethics Committee. Quantitative data were analysed in SPSS v22 (IBM). A total of 382 patients were recruited to the service; 280 (73%) remained at follow-up. Ten patients were interviewed and 43 completed the questionnaire. A total of 613 goals were set; mean of 1.7 goals per patient. Fifty percent of goals were met at follow-up. There were significant improvements in PAM, EQ-5D-5L and EQ-VAS scores and significant reductions in systolic blood pressure, BMI and HDL cholesterol ratio at follow-up. Mean NHS service use costs were significantly lower at follow-up; with a mean decrease per patient of £236.43 (±SD £968.47). The mean cost per patient for providing the service was £203.10, resulting in potential cost-savings of £33.33 per patient (SD ± 874.65). Questionnaire respondents reported high levels of satisfaction with the service. This study suggests that the service is acceptable to patients and may lead to improvements in health outcomes and allows for modest cost savings. Limitations of the study included the low response rate to the patient questionnaire",10.1111/hsc.12992
4746,How is quality of life defined and assessed in published research?,Health Status; Humans; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Definition; Health-related quality of life; Patient-reported outcome measures; Patient-reported outcomes; Quality of life; Terminology,"PURPOSE: To ensure clarity in communication in the field of quality of life research, and meaningful use of 'quality of life' as a research outcome, requires two things: awareness that there is a range of conceptualisations and definitions of 'quality of life', and for any particular study, consistency between the way the term is defined and operationalised in that setting. We aimed to identify how frequently research articles described (HR)QOL as a construct of interest, how frequently they referred to ""patient-reported outcome (measures)"", which patient-reported outcome measures were used, and how (HR)QOL was defined METHODS: We reviewed all Quality of Life Research articles published in 2017 and recorded whether they described health-related quality of life or quality of life as constructs of interest, and/or mentioned the term(s) patient-reported outcome (measures). We recorded definitions of (HR)QOL stated and questionnaires used. We classified articles according to constructs assessed and instruments used, and examined whether articles citing the same definition used the same questionnaires. RESULTS: We reviewed 300 articles; 65% stated that (HR)QOL was a construct of interest, 27% mentioned patient-reported outcome (measures), and 20% mentioned neither. Fifty-one articles provided definitions of (HR)QOL, citing 66 sources, with 11 definitions cited more than once. PROMIS, SF, EQ-5D, and EORTC instruments were the most commonly used. The only definition and questionnaire consistently used together were the WHO definitions/instruments. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate considerable heterogeneity in the definition and operationalisation of (HR)QOL, between and within studies. This limits meaningful interpretation of (HR)QOL scores and complicates literature searches Investigators should define constructs and select instruments aligned with their definitions",10.1007/s11136-021-02826-0

Analyses of survival data typically adjust for this bias, but such adjustments are rarely performed in analyses of patient-reported outcomes. This analysis aimed to examine the impact of adjusting for treatment switching on estimated treatment effects on 5-level version of EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) utilities and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The AURA3 trial (NCT02151981) was a randomized controlled trial comparing osimertinib with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (standard care) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic epidermal growth factor receptor mutant- and T790M-positive nonsmall cell lung cancer whose disease has progressed with previous epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy METHODS: Descriptive analyses were used to compare treatment arms. The primary analysis used a 2-stage least squares instrumental variable regression to estimate treatment effect adjusting for treatment crossover. Time to deterioration, defined from baseline to minimally important deterioration in EQ-5D-5L utility, was assessed using a rank preserving structural failure time model. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis of imputed data showed incremental QALYs for osimertinib of 0.23 at 60 weeks. Accounting for treatment switching increased this to 0.52 in the primary analysis and to 0.63 QALYs in sensitivity analysis at 150 weeks. Time to deterioration analysis showed longer health-related quality of life maintenance with osimertinib, of 12.76 weeks, although this was at the borderline of statistical significance (acceleration factor, ψ = -0.275; 95% confidence interval -0.50 to 0.00). CONCLUSIONS: This analysis demonstrates methods to adjust for treatment switching in the analysis of EQ-5D-5L from clinical trials. Failure to account for crossover substantially underestimated the QALY gain for osimertinib",10.1016/j.jval.2022.01.022

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of nivolumab on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) after radical resection in patients with MIUC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We used data from 709 patients in CheckMate 274 (NCT02632409; 282 with programmed death ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression ≥1%), an ongoing randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial of adjuvant nivolumab INTERVENTION: Intravenous injection of nivolumab (240 mg) or placebo every 2 wk for ≤1 yr. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: HRQoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and the EQ-5D-3L. Linear mixed-effect models for repeated measures were used to compare nivolumab and placebo on changes in HRQoL. Time to confirmed deterioration (TTCD) of HRQoL was analyzed by Cox proportional hazards regression. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: In the full HRQoL evaluable population, no clinically meaningful deterioration of HRQoL was observed in either treatment arm. Moreover, nivolumab was noninferior to placebo on changes from baseline for all main outcomes. The median TTCD for fatigue was 41.0 wk for nivolumab and 44.3 wk for placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89-1.39). For the visual analog scale, the median TTCD was not reached for nivolumab and it was 57.6 wk for placebo (HR: 0.78, 95% CI, 0.61-1.00). The median TTCD for the other main outcomes was not reached in either treatment arm. The findings were similar for patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1%. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that nivolumab did not compromise the HRQoL of patients with MIUC in CheckMate 274. PATIENT SUMMARY: Nivolumab is being researched as a new treatment for patients with bladder cancer (urothelial carcinoma). We found that nivolumab maintained quality of life while increasing the time until cancer returns in patients whose bladder cancer had spread or grown and who had unsuccessfully tried platinum-containing chemotherapy",10.1016/j.euo.2022.02.003

There is little information on whether their use is effective. This was a prospective randomized trial and cost-effectiveness analysis of silver-donating versus non-silver low-adherence dressings in the treatment of venous leg ulcers. METHODS: Patients were randomized between the two types of dressing. The primary outcome measure was complete ulcer healing at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes included time to healing, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: A total of 213 patients were recruited. There was no difference between the dressings in the proportion of ulcers healed at 12 weeks (59.6 per cent for silver and 56.7 per cent for control dressings). Mean utility scores for the EuroQol 5D and Short Form 6D were similar in both groups at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. Compared with the control group the antimicrobial group had an incremental cost of pounds sterling 97.85 and an incremental quality-adjusted life year gain of 0.0002, giving an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of pounds sterling 489 250 for the antimicrobial dressings. CONCLUSION: No significant differences were found in either primary or secondary endpoints. There was no evidence to support the routine use of silver-donating dressings beneath compression for venous ulceration.

Studies comparing outcome according to preoperative pain predominance and treatment received are lacking. PURPOSE: The purpose was to study if adding spinal fusion to the decompression in DS affects outcome in patients with PBP (back pain [BP] Visual Analog Scale [VAS] more than or equal to leg pain [LP] VAS) compared with predominant leg pain (PLP) (BP VAS less than LP VAS). PATIENT SAMPLE: The Swedish Spine Register was used and included 1,624 patients operated for DS at the L4-L5 level. OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported measures were used, including a VAS for BP and LP, the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), and the physical and mental component summaries of the Short-Form 36 to estimate health-related quality of life and the Oswestry disability index (ODI) to estimate function. METHODS: Inclusion criterion was single-level DS operated on with either decompression only (D) or decompression and instrumented posterolateral fusion (DF). Based on preoperative LP and BP scores, the patients were assigned to one of the two groups: LP predominance or BP predominance. The patients completed the outcome protocol at 1- and 2-year follow-ups. Statistical analysis was performed using linear regression adjusting for multiple potential confounders. RESULTS: In the adjusted outcome at the 1-year follow-up, patients with PLP reported a 7.9-mm more improvement on the VAS for BP with fusion, compared with D (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.7-15.2), p=.03. Despite more change in the fused group, the reported BP levels remained similar in the D versus decompressed and fused at the 1-year follow-up (28 vs. 24, p=.77). The patients with PBP benefited from adding fusion in terms of BP 7.1 (95% CI, 0.3-13.9, p=.04), LP 8.8 (2-15.7, p=.01), the ODI 5.7 (1.6-9.9, p=.006), and the EQ-5D 0.09 (1.7-0.02, p=.02) at the 1-year follow-up as the DF group reported greater change in the outcome compared with the D group. At the 2-year follow-up, no significant differences were found between D and decompressed and fused in either the LP or the PBP groups. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with PBP operated with DF report better outcomes in terms of pain, function, and health-related quality of life than patients with D. Although these differences are significant on a group level, they may fail to reach minimal clinical significant difference. Patients with PLP report significantly more improvement in terms of BP with DF compared with D, but because of baseline differences in preoperative BP, these improvements may not be explained by the added fusion per se. At the 2-year follow-up, no significant differences were observed between the D and DF patients in either the PBP or PLP groups, but greater loss to follow-up in the DF groups could potentially bias these findings",10.1016/j.spinee.2014.11.020
9074,No clinical advantage of locking over nonlocking plate fixation of symphyseal disruptions,"Adult; Bone Plates; Cohort Studies; Female; Fracture Fixation, Internal; Humans; Male; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life","PURPOSE: although locking plates have led to important changes in fracture management, becoming important tools in the orthopedic surgeon's arsenal, the benefits of locking plates for traumatic diastasis of the pubic symphysis have not been established. This study was conducted to assess the quality of life in its different domains among patients with traumatic diastasis of the pubic symphysis managed either with locking or nonlocking plate. METHODS: a prospective cohort study was undertaken at 3 level 1 trauma centres in Brazil. Patients presenting traumatic diastasis of the pubic symphysis treated with plate fixation with a minimum follow-up of 12 months were eligible for inclusion. Through a Pfannenstiel approach, the pubic symphysis was reduced and fixed with a superiorly positioned 4.5mm four to six hole reconstruction locked plate or 3.5mm four to six hole reconstruction nonlocked plate. Posterior injury was managed during the same procedure. Outcome measures were adequate healing of the pelvic injuries, return to pre-injury level on daily activities, and quality of life at the last follow-up visit. Complications and modes of failure were summarized and reviewed. Bivariate linear regression was used to assess individual factors affecting patients' health-related quality of life. A p value of <5% was considered significant. RESULTS: a total of 31 adult patients (29 males and 2 females) were eligible for the study. Thirteen patients were managed with a reconstruction locked plate and 18 patients with a nonlocked reconstruction plate. Average postoperative follow-up time was 24 months. Adequate healing of the pelvic injuries was achieved in 61.5% of patients treated with locking plates and 94.4% of patients treated with nonlocking plates (p=0.003). Radiographic failure of fixation with minor complications occurred in 46.1% of patients after locked plating versus 11.1% of patients in the nonlocking plate group (p=0.0003) In bivariate analysis, abnormal gait (p=0.007) was associated with a reduced long-term quality of life as measured with the EQ-5D-3L. CONCLUSION: internal fixation of traumatic diastasis of the pubic symphysis with locking plates has no clinical advantage when compared to nonlocked plating. Mechanical failure and inadequate healing are significantly increased after locked plating of the pubic symphysis. Therefore, we do not recommend routine use of locking plates for managing patients presenting traumatic diastasis of the pubic symphysis.

The disease is rapidly spread around the world causing thousands of deaths and posing critical challenges for public health and clinical research in the world. The outbreak was declared by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a public health emergency of international concern. Nowadays, there are more than 18 millions of confirmed cases of coronavirus across the world with a total of 702,903 deaths [2]. In Morocco, there are 28,500 confirmed cases and 345 deaths Forecasts for the cumulative number of confirmed, recovered, active and death cases were recently provided [3]. To manage the pandemic spread several countries adopted proactive and preventive measures including home confinement of the population. However, there is evidence that these measures, particularly home confinement, can cause unprecedented disruption in the well-being of the population. Being forced to stay at home and the daily activities' restrictions could impact the citizens' health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and behavior-related lifestyle. It has been reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on psychological behaviors [4], mental health [5] and anxiety/depression [6]. The Moroccan population was under home confinement from March 20, 2020. Assessing rapidly and simply the HRQoL during crisis such as the home confinement is a challenge of interest to provide speedy information to authorities which allow best management of damages yielding in crisis situation The EQ-5D instrument is a generic questionnaire developed by the Euroqol group for measuring the HRQoL by combining five health dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) [7]. The EQ-5D instrument is translated into more than 300 languages and exhibit good reliability and validity in both patients and general population. Herein, we used the EQ-5D-5L instrument to assess for the first time the impact of the home confinement on the HRQoL. Also, we evaluated the changes in behaviors by asking some questions related to lifestyle before and during the home confinement. These data can help the Moroccan authorities and other countries to more understand the impact of this crisis on citizens and therefore to set up adequate protocols for managing the post-confinement or possible future crisis. We provided two datasets: (1) data we collected before confinement from a sample of 484 individuals describing their HRQoL [8] and (2) data we collected during the home confinement period from a sample of 537 individuals describing their HRQoL and behavior-related lifestyle",10.1016/j.dib.2020.106239

However, when ultrasound and mammography are negative, the chances of malignancy are lower than 5%. Currently, major duct excision and microdochectomy are often recommended to alleviate symptoms and definitely rule out malignancy, but can cause infections and breastfeeding problems. Ductoscopy is a minimally invasive endoscopy technique that allows visualization of the mammary ducts and may not only obviate surgery but also detect malignancy. The aim of this study was to determine quality of life (QOL) after ductoscopy in patients with PND. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All PND patients referred for ductoscopy between 2014 and 2015 to our hospital were included Ductoscopy procedures were performed under local anaesthesia in the outpatient clinic. Patients were asked to fill out questionnaires (Breast-Q, EQ-5D-5L and SF-36) on the day of ductoscopy, and after 2 weeks, 3 and 6 months. Additionally, we performed reliability analysis to determine if these questionnaires were suitable for PND patients. RESULTS: Fifty consecutive patients underwent ductoscopy of whom 47 patients participated in this study. One domain of SF-36 (vitality) varied significantly over time. Breast-Q, SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L showed that QOL after ductoscopy for PND was unaffected by ductoscopy. Success of the ductoscopy procedure was a significant predictor for satisfaction with the result domain. CONCLUSION: Ductoscopy is a minimally invasive technique that does not seem to impact QoL of PND patients over time. Breast-Q, SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L seem to be suitable existing QOL tests for PND patients undergoing ductoscopy, whereas SF-36 would require modifications",10.1007/s12282-020-01184-y

DESIGN: Feasibility study. SETTING: Residential care homes for older people. PARTICIPANTS: 10-15 residents, staff and family members will be recruited in each of the three participating care homes INTERVENTION: ARCH is a 12-month 'whole-systems' programme implemented by occupational therapists and physiotherapists. They will conduct a comprehensive assessment of each care home, considering the physical environment, working practices and organisation structure as well as residents' individual needs, and recommend ways to address barriers and increase residents' activity levels. The therapists will then work with staff to improve understanding of the issues, instigate training, environmental, organisational and working practice changes as necessary. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Residents' activity levels, health and quality of life will be tested using several measures to see which are practicable and appropriate for this population in this context. This includes: Assessment of Physical Activity in Frail Older People; Pool Activity Level Checklist; Dementia Care Mapping observations; and EQ-5D-5L. Residents will be assessed prior to programme implementation then 4- and 12-months post-implementation Semi-structured interviews will explore the experiences of residents, staff, family members and therapists. CONCLUSIONS: Providing evidence of effectiveness and acceptability of ARCH, and documenting factors that impede/facilitate implementation will help us identify ways to enhance the care and quality of life of older people in residential care, and our understanding of how to implement them.

Improving quality of life is therefore a key treatment goal. We report quality of life for patients with RAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer in the PRIME study. METHODS: A randomised phase 3 open-label study of first-line panitumumab+FOLFOX4 vs FOLFOX4 enrolled adults with untreated metastatic colorectal cancer and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. This analysis includes patients with wild-type RAS tumours (n=505). Quality of life (prespecified end point) was assessed using the EuroQoL 5-domain health state index and overall health rating in all patients and by early tumour shrinkage status (≥30% reduction in size by week 8; exploratory end point). Differences in quality of life were assessed using analysis of covariance and a mixed-effect piecewise linear model, and were also analysed by skin toxicity severity. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between treatment arms from baseline to progression or to discontinuation. Grade 3+ skin toxicity was reported by 38% of patients receiving panitumumab+FOLFOX4 and 2% receiving FOLFOX4 alone. There were no significant differences in quality of life between patients with grade 0-2 skin toxicity and those with grade 3+ skin toxicity. More patients receiving panitumumab+FOLFOX4 vs FOLFOX4 had early tumour shrinkage (p<.001). In patients with tumour symptoms at baseline, there were statistically significant improvements in quality of life in those with early tumour shrinkage versus those without early tumour shrinkage. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of panitumumab to FOLFOX4 in first-line therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer prolongs survival and has no negative effect on overall quality of life compared with FOLFOX4 alone. Specific quality of life assessments for skin toxicity should be included in study designs to better define the direct effect of these adverse events.

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on a convenience sample of adults with arthritis-related pain in Australia from an access research panel. The survey was administered to 1039 participants who reported experiencing pain or loss of mobility as a result of their arthritis. The survey covered details of their condition, descriptions of the pain, impacts of pain on their daily lives, information regarding pain management and medication, the Measure of Intermittent and Constant Osteoarthritis Pain (ICOAP) tool, the EQ5D (a standardized measure of health tool) and demographic information. RESULTS: Osteoarthritis (OA) was the most common form of arthritis (69% of respondents). The back (65%), knees (64%) and fingers (61%) were the regions in which pain was most commonly reported; 87% of respondents reported that their pain tended to change in intensity, with exercise and cold weather producing significantly increased levels of pain. Forty-seven percent of patients reported that the worst impact of arthritis was on their capacity to carry out activities of daily living. The majority of patients (71%) found their pain management programs to be of 'medium effectiveness' or 'fairly effective', although 17% described it as ineffective. CONCLUSION: Persons with arthritis in Australia demonstrate marked pain-related functional impairment characterized by difficulty with many aspects of daily activity. The results suggest that a substantial benefit may be derived from increased awareness of the disease and increased knowledge about the potential for improved management",10.1111/1756-185X.12232

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted-life-year (QALY) when comparing circumferential fusion to posterolateral fusion in a long-term, societal perspective. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The cost-effectiveness of circumferential fusion in a long-term perspective is uncertain but nonetheless highly relevant as the ISSLS prize winner 2006 in clinical studies reported the effect of circumferential fusion superior to the effect of posterolateral fusion. A recent trial found no significant difference between posterolateral and circumferential fusion reporting cost-effectiveness from a 2-year viewpoint. METHODS: A total of 146 patients were randomized to posterolateral or circumferential fusion and followed 4 to 8 years after surgery The mean age of the cohort was 46 years (range, 20-65 years); 61% were females, 49% were smokers, 30% had primary diagnosis of isthmic spondylolisthesis, 35% had disc degeneration and no previous surgery, and 35% had disc degeneration and previous surgery. Eighty-two percent of patients have had symptoms for more than 2 years and 50% were out of the labor market due to sickness. The EQ-5D instrument was applied for the measurement of health-related quality of life and costs (2004 U.S. dollars) were measured in a full-scale societal perspective Productivity costs were valued by the Friction Cost method, and both costs and effects were discounted. Arithmetic means and 95% bias-corrected, bootstrapped confidence intervals were reported. Nonparametric statistics were used for tests of statistical significance. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis was conducted and reported using cost-effectiveness acceptability curves. RESULTS: The circumferential group demonstrated clinical superiority over the posterolateral fusion group in functional outcome (P < 0.01), fusion rate (P < 0.04), and number of reoperations (P < 0.01) among others. Cost-utility analysis demonstrated circumferential fusion dominant over posterolateral fusion, that is, for each QALY gained performing circumferential fusion, the incremental saving was estimated at U.S. $49,306 (95% confidence interval, $27,183-$2,735,712). Results proved to be strong to various sensitivity analyses; only a differentiated underestimation of patients' need for postoperative household help against the circumferential approach could alter the dominance; however, still the probability of cost-effectiveness was >0.85 given a threshold for willingness to pay of U.S. $50,000 per QALY. CONCLUSION: Circumferential fusion is dominant over instrumented posterolateral fusion, that is, both being significantly cheaper and significantly better in a long-term, societal perspective",10.1097/BRS.0b013e3181573b2d
10643,Utilities of the EQ-5D: transferable or not?,"Economics, Pharmaceutical/statistics & numerical data; Europe; Health Status; Humans; Quality of Life","BACKGROUND: Within the framework of economic evaluations, the transferability of utility scores between jurisdictions remains unclear. The EQ-5D is a generic instrument for measuring health-related quality of life in economic evaluations, which can be used for comparing utility scores across countries. At present, the EQ-5D has several national value sets or tariffs. Nevertheless, utility estimates from foreign studies are often used directly for cost-effectiveness estimates, without adapting by applying the appropriate national value set. It is unclear if this practice is advisable, due to dissimilarities between the national value sets. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of differences in national EQ-5D value sets on absolute and marginal utilities of health states, and determine to what degree these differences can be explained by methodological factors. METHODS: First, the relative importance of the EQ-5D domains for the utility estimates was compared across the 15 value sets. Second, two hypothetical health states for a depressed patient and a pain patient (21232 and 33321) were selected for additional analysis, by comparing the utilities as scored by the value sets. The marginal influence of a one-level deterioration in a domain of these health states on the utility estimate was then determined. Third, the differences between the value sets were examined in more detail by using multilevel analysis to examine the role of methodological differences in the valuation studies RESULTS: Differences can be perceived between the national value sets of the EQ-5D in the preferences for the domains. The utilities of the two hypothetical health states show that the value sets differ substantially. Furthermore, the differences between the marginal values of the deteriorations are large, which can be explained partly by the type of valuation method. Other methodological differences also influence the value sets. CONCLUSIONS: All results indicate that the differences between the EQ-5D value sets are considerable and should not be ignored. The differences can largely be explained by methodological differences in the valuation studies. The remaining differences may reflect cultural dissimilarities between countries. Therefore, further research should focus on investigating the transferability of utilities across countries or agreeing on a standard to perform valuation studies. For the time being, transferring utilities from one country to another without any adjustment is not advisable",10.2165/11314120-000000000-00000

Here, we describe the protocol for a randomized controlled study designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of GGTCS for the treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of GGTCS for the treatment of CRS, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, clinical trial has been designed. A total of 58 participants with CRS will be recruited and randomly allocated to a GGTCS or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio. The participants will be administered GGTCS or placebo granules 3 times a day for 8 weeks. Data will be collected from the participants at baseline and at 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after random allocation. The primary outcome measure will be the mean change in the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 score from baseline to 8 weeks. The secondary outcomes will include the Total Nasal Symptom Score, EuroQoL 5 Dimensions 5 Levels score, Nasal Endoscopy Index, Lund-Mackay score, and total serum immunoglobulin E level DISCUSSION: The key elements for conducting a high-quality randomized clinical trial have been addressed in this protocol. In summary, the findings of this study are expected to provide a base for large-scale randomized controlled trials to confirm the safety and efficacy of GGTCS for the treatment of CRS and may consequently serve to improve future treatment strategies for this condition TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study has been registered at the Korean National Clinical Trial Registry, Clinical Research Information Service (KCT0002835)",10.1097/MD.0000000000011196

My Therapy is a self-management program which encourages independent practice of occupational therapy and physiotherapy exercises and activities, outside of supervised therapy sessions. METHODS: This implementation trial aims to determine both the clinical effectiveness of My Therapy on the outcomes of function and health-related quality of life, and cost-effectiveness per minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in functional independence achieved and per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained, compared to usual care. Using a stepped-wedge cluster randomised design, My Therapy will be implemented across eight rehabilitation wards (inpatient and home-based) within two public and two private Australian health networks, over 54-weeks. We will include 2,160 patients aged 18 + years receiving rehabilitation for any diagnosis. Each ward will transition from the usual care condition (control group receiving usual care) to the experimental condition (intervention group receiving My Therapy in addition to usual care) sequentially at six-week intervals. The primary clinical outcome is achievement of a MCID in the Functional Independence Measure (FIM™) at discharge Secondary outcomes include improvement in quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) at discharge, length of stay, 30-day re-admissions, discharge accommodation, follow-up rehabilitation services and adverse events (falls). The economic outcomes are the cost-effectiveness per MCID in functional independence (FIM™) achieved and per QALY gained, for My Therapy compared to usual care, from a health-care sector perspective. Cost of implementation will also be reported Clinical outcomes will be analysed via mixed-effects linear or logistic regression models, and economic outcomes will be analysed via incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. DISCUSSION: The My Therapy implementation trial will determine the effect of adding self-management within inpatient rehabilitation care. The results may influence health service models of rehabilitation including recommendations for systemic change to the inpatient rehabilitation model of care to include self-management. Findings have the potential to improve patient function and quality of life, and the ability to participate in self-management Potential health service benefits include reduced hospital length of stay, improved access to rehabilitation and reduced health service costs.

METHODS: Cross-sectional survey of 540 patients with Medicaid insurance and type 2 diabetes in Los Angeles County. The Primary Care Assessment Tool was used to measure seven features of medical home performance The EuroQol EQ-5D-3L (EQ-5D) was used to measure HRQOL. RESULTS: Higher total medical home performance was correlated with better overall HRQOL. A one-point change in total medical home score was associated with a 0.06-point higher score on the EQ-5D index [95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.01-0.11], which is a clinically meaningful difference. The total score was also significantly associated with a lower likelihood of problems on one domain of the EQ-5D (pain) Longitudinality was the only medical home feature associated with better general health status (ordered odds ratio = 1.78; 95 % CI: 1.04-3.03). The positive relationship of medical home with the EQ-5D appears to be present predominantly among women. CONCLUSION: Overall medical home experience is favorably associated with HRQOL among vulnerable adult patients with type 2 diabetes. Provider efforts to improve the overall medical home experience for patients may contribute to improvements in HRQOL",10.1007/s11606-014-3033-4

Exclusion criteria were: recent treatment at the CCC; failure to complete four treatment sessions; and age under 16 years. Outcome measures included comparison of pre- and post-treatment levels of physical (pain, disability, immobility, sleep disturbances, reliance upon medication, daily activities) and psychological (stress, panic, fear, anger, relaxation, coping, depression/anxiety) functioning; these were assessed using a questionnaire with visual analogue scales for subjective rating of symptoms and the EuroQoL (EQ-5D), a generic state-of-health measure. RESULTS: Wilcoxon signed ranks tests showed statistically significant improvements in both psychological and physical functioning, particularly in stress reduction (median stress levels fell by four points), pain relief (median pain ratings fell by two points), increased ability to cope (median improvement of three points) and increased general health ratings (median improvement of 20 points) between study entry and end of treatment (P < 0.0004 for all these symptoms). The most substantial improvements were seen in those with the most severe symptoms at study entry. No adverse effects of treatment were documented CONCLUSIONS: This audit of treatment outcomes provides evidence consistent with the hypothesis that healing, as provided at the CCC, was associated with improved psychological and physical functioning in the majority of subjects, and is worthy of further evaluation",10.1016/j.puhe.2004.03.003

AIM OF THE STUDY: To compare the efficacy and safety of PG201 and SKI306X in patients with knee osteoarthritis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective, double-blinded multicenter study was conducted in 124 patients with Kellgren and Lawrence grade 2-3 knee osteoarthritis. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 600mg of PG201 (300mg, twice daily) and 600mg of SKI306X placebo (200mg, thrice daily) or 600mg of SKI306X (200mg, thrice daily) and PG201 placebo (300mg, twice daily) for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the improvement of pain by week 8 as assessed by the 100-mm pain visual analog scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes included pain VAS improvement level at week 12, pain VAS improvement rate at weeks 8 and 12, the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) improvement level at weeks 8 and 12, the improvement of the quality of life (EQ-5D), overall symptom self-assessment score, and rescue medication consumption. RESULTS: The pain VAS improvement at 8 weeks was 14.2±16.2 in the experimental group and 11.9±13.1 in control group (p=0.557), confirming that the experimental group was not inferior to the control group as lower limit (-8.38) of 95% CI of the difference of VAS improvement between two groups was well above the allowed limit (-10 mm). There was no significant difference in all secondary outcomes including pain VAS, WOMAC, EQ-5D, overall symptom self-assessment score, and rescue medication consumption. Adverse events were low and similar between the two groups.

We aimed to investigate the health preferences of patients with heart disease and develop a value set for the 5-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) based on these patient preferences METHODS: Patients with confirmed heart disease were recruited from 2 hospitals in Singapore. A total of 86 EQ-5D-5L health states (10 per patient) were valued using a composite time trade-off method according to the international valuation protocol for EQ-5D-5L; 20-parameter linear models and 8-parameter cross-attribute level effects models with and without an N45 term (indicating whether any health state dimension at level 4 or 5 existed) were estimated. Each model included patient-specific random intercepts. Model performance was evaluated for out-of-sample and in-sample predictive accuracy in terms of root mean square error. The discriminative ability of the utility values was assessed using heart disease-related functional classes. RESULTS: A total of 576 patients were included in the analysis. The preferred model, with the lowest out-of-sample root mean square error, was a 20-parameter linear model including N45. Predicted utility values ranged from -0.727 for the worst state to 1 for full health; the value for the second-best state was 0.981. Utility values demonstrated good discriminative ability in differentiating among patients of varied functional classes. CONCLUSIONS: An EQ-5D-5L value set representing the preferences of patients with heart disease was developed. The value set could be used for patient-centric economic evaluation and health-related quality of life assessment for patients with heart disease",10.1016/j.jval.2021.09.010

The two studies used near-identical methods, except that in England, data were collected in one-to-one interviews with substantial amounts of interviewer assistance, whereas in the Netherlands, the computer aid was used as a self-completion tool in group interviews with lesser amounts of interviewer assistance. In total, 801 members of the general public (403 in England; 398 in the Netherlands) each completed five TTO valuations of EQ-5D-5L health states. Respondents in the Netherlands study showed a greater tendency to give 'round number' values such as 0 and 1 and to complete tasks using a minimal number of iterative steps. They also showed a greater tendency to skip the animated instructions that preceded the first task and to take into account assumptions that they were specifically asked not to take into account. When faced with a pair of health states in which one state dominated the other, respondents in the Netherlands study were more likely than those in the England study to give a higher value to the dominant health state. On the basis of these comparisons, we conclude that the one-to-one, interviewer-led setting is superior to the group, self-complete setting in terms of the quality of data generated and that the former is more suitable than the latter for TTO studies being used to value EQ-5D-5L",10.1007/s10198-013-0509-9

METHODS: A total of 135 outpatients with schizophrenia > or =60 years of age were treated with olanzapine (n = 105) or another antipsychotic (n = 30) and followed up for 6 months. Safety measures included the recording of spontaneous adverse events and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). Clinical status and effectiveness of the medications were measured using the Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness and the Global Assessment of Function (GAF) scales. Quality of life was assessed by means of the Spanish version of the EuroQol. The Awad scale was applied to evaluate patients' subjective attitude towards medication. RESULTS: The incidence of overall adverse events and EPS was non-significantly lower in patients treated with olanzapine than in patients treated with other antipsychotics. The use of anticholinergic drugs was significantly lower (P = 0.04) in patients treated with olanzapine Both groups of patients experienced similar improvements in Clinical Global Impressions-Severity and GAF scores. Non-significantly greater improvement in the acceptance of medication occurred at endpoint in olanzapine-treated patients than in control patients as measured by the Awad scale. The improvement in the EuroQol quality of life scale achieved at the end of study did not differ between both treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Results from this naturalistic study showed that olanzapine was as safe and effective as other antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of elderly patients with schizophrenia,10.1016/j.eurpsy.2004.06.008

OBJECTIVE: To determine patient characteristics that influence pain and function independent of joint status. METHODS: US adults with hemophilia completed a survey that included information on clinical characteristics, demographics, and patient-reported outcome instruments assessing pain (Brief Pain Inventory v2 Short Form [BPI]), functional impairment (Hemophilia Activities List [HAL]), and health status (EQ-5D-5L). Additionally, physiotherapists optionally completed a clinical joint evaluation (Hemophilia Joint Health Score [HJHS]). Associations were examined using simple and multiple regression models. RESULTS: Of 381 adults enrolled, 240 had complete HJHS scores (median age, 32 years). After controlling for HJHS and opiate use, anxiety/anxiolytic use was significantly associated with worse pain severity and interference scores. After controlling for HJHS, the most significant predictors of functional impairment were older age, unemployment, more severe hemophilia, and greater pain. EQ-5D-5L pain/discomfort was associated with worse outcomes on most HAL scores. CONCLUSION: Unemployment, anxiety, and depression were each associated with both greater pain and functional disability after controlling for joint status. Continued attention to pain and psychosocial issues will be important in improving clinical care and research efforts in the hemophilia population",10.1111/ejh.13025

SETTING: A rheumatology inpatient rehabilitation centre in Denmark SUBJECTS: A total of 165 adults (aged ⩾ 18 years) with chronic low back pain INTERVENTIONS: An integrated rehabilitation programme comprising an alternation of three weeks of inpatient stay and 12 weeks of home-based activities was compared with an existing rehabilitation programme of four weeks of inpatient stay. MAIN MEASURES: Patient-reported outcomes were collected at baseline and at the 26-week follow-up. The primary outcome was back-specific disability (Oswestry Disability Index). Secondary outcomes included pain intensity (Numerical Rating Scale), pain self-efficacy (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire), health-related quality of life (EuroQol-5 Domain 5-level (EQ-5D)), and depression (Major Depression Inventory). A complete case analysis was performed. RESULTS: A total of 303 patients were assessed for eligibility of whom 165 (mean age: 50 years (SD 13) and mean Oswestry Disability Index score 42 (SD 11)) were randomized (83 to existing rehabilitation programme and 82 to integrated rehabilitation programme) Overall, 139 patients provided the 26-week follow-up data. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between programmes. The between-group difference in the Oswestry Disability Index score when adjusting for the corresponding baseline score was -0.28 (95% confidence interval (CI): -4.02, 3.45) which was neither statistically nor clinically significant. No significant differences were found in the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSION: An integrated rehabilitation programme was no more effective than an existing rehabilitation programme at the 26-week follow-up",10.1177/0269215519897968

The Duke Health Profile (DHP) has been translated and culturally adapted for use in Vietnam, but its reliability and validity for use with stroke patients in Vietnam or elsewhere have not been assessed. METHODS: First-ever stroke patients (n = 108) who were admitted to 115 People's Hospital between February and September 2012 and survived for 3 months after stroke had HRQoL assessed using the DHP and a comparison instrument (EQ-5D). Caregivers of 94 patients completed these questionnaires as a proxy. After 1 week, these questionnaires were re-administered to patients and proxies. RESULTS: The mean differences between test and retest assessments of HRQoL by patients were small and not clinically meaningful and were not consistently associated with sex, age, type of stroke or severity of impairment or disability. Direct assessments by the patient were on average greater than those obtained from the proxy. The ICCs ranged from 0.60 to 0.86 (patient test-retest) and from 0.55 to 0.98 (patient-proxy agreement). The ICCs were greatest for physical functioning components (patient test-retest 0.63-0.86, patient-proxy 0.69-0.98). The correlations between the DHP dimensions and EQ-5D were generally stronger when they measured similar constructs (r = 0.53-0.66) and were lower for less related constructs (r = 0.11-0.43). CONCLUSION: The DHP has moderate reliability and validity for use with stroke patients in Vietnam even when information is obtained from proxy respondents",10.1007/s11136-015-1016-5

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective observational study in a tertiary ICU was conducted. Communication-related quality of life was measured daily using the Visual Analogue Self-Esteem Scale. General health status was measured weekly using the EuroQol-5D. RESULTS: Aspects of communication self-esteem that significantly improved with the return of voice were ability to be understood by others (P = .006) and cheerfulness (P = .04), both with a median difference from before to after return of voice of 1 on the 5-point scale. Return of voice was not associated with a significant improvement in confidence, sense of outgoingness, anger, sense of being trapped, optimism, or frustration. Reported general health status did not significantly improve. CONCLUSIONS: Return of voice was associated with significant improvement in patient reported self-esteem, particularly in being understood by others and in cheerfulness. Improved self-esteem may also improve quality of life; however, further research is needed to confirm this relationship. Early restoration of voice should be investigated as a way to improve the experience of ICU for tracheostomy patients",10.1016/j.jcrc.2016.01.012
2280,Evaluating the Minimal Clinically Important Difference of EQ-5D-3L in Patients With Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis: A Swiss Prospective Multicenter Cohort Study,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Female; Health Surveys/methods/standards; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Minimal Clinically Important Difference; Pain Measurement/methods/standards; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Spinal Stenosis/diagnosis/epidemiology/surgery; Switzerland/epidemiology; Treatment Outcome","STUDY DESIGN: Analysis of a prospective, multicenter cohort study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to compare thresholds of published minimal clinically important differences (MCID) for the three-level EuroQol-5D health survey (EQ-5D-3L) summary index (range -0.53 to 1.00) with our anchor-based estimate and evaluate how useful these thresholds are in determining treatment success in patients undergoing surgery for degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (DLSS) SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: MCID values for EQ-5D-3L are specific to the underlying disease and only three studies have been published for DLSS patients reporting different values. METHODS: Patients of the multicenter Lumbar Stenosis Outcome Study with confirmed DLSS undergoing first-time decompression or fusion surgery with 12-month follow-up were enrolled in this study. To calculate MCID we used the Spinal Stenosis Measure satisfaction subscale as anchor. RESULTS: For this study, 364 patients met the inclusion criteria; of these, 196 were very satisfied, 72 moderately satisfied, 43 somewhat satisfied, and 53 unsatisfied 12 months after surgery. The MCID calculation estimated for EQ-5D-3L a value of 0.19. Compared with published MCID values (ranging from 0.30 to 0.52), our estimation is less restrictive. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with LSS undergoing surgery, we estimated an MCID value for EQ-5D-3L summary index of 0.19 with the help of the average change anchor-based method, which we find to be the most suitable method for assessing patient change scores.

METHODS: A 70  yr old male, diagnosed with PD 7 years prior to study enrolment, self-administered CVS at home 2×20 minutes per day for three months using a solid-state portable device. Standardised neuropsychological assessments of motor, cognitive, affective and independent function were carried out prior to stimulation, at the start and end of the sham (month 1) and active (months 2-3) phases, and 5 months post-stimulation. RESULTS: Relative to the pre-stimulation baseline, behavioural improvements that exceeded the minimal detectable change were observed on the EQ5D, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, Schwab and England scale, 2 minute walk, Timed up and go, Non-motor symptom assessment scale for PD, Montreal cognitive assessment, Hospital depression scale and Epworth sleepiness scale. The level of change exceeded the threshold for a minimal clinically important difference on all scales for which a threshold has been published. By contrast, little improvement was seen during the sham (i.e., placebo) phase. CONCLUSION: Caloric vestibular stimulation may offer a novel, home-based method of relieving everyday symptoms of PD, and merits further evaluative study",10.3233/NRE-161308

Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is widely used to decrease breast cancer recurrence and mortality among patients. However, it also increases the risk of endometrial cancer. This study aimed to assess knowledge and decisional conflict regarding tamoxifen use. Between June and October 2014, breast cancer patients using tamoxifen were consecutively screened and requested to complete a survey including the EQ-5D, Satisfaction with Decision Scale (SWD), Decisional Conflict Scale (DCS), and a self-developed, 15-item questionnaire measuring tamoxifen-related knowledge. The study sample comprised 299 patients. The mean total knowledge score was 63.4 of a possible 100.0 (range, 13.3-93.3). While 73.9% of the participants knew that tamoxifen reduces the risk of breast cancer recurrence, only 57.9% knew that the drug increases endometrial cancer risk. A higher education level (≥ college) was associated with a higher, total knowledge score (β = 4.291; P = 0.017). A higher knowledge score was associated with a decreased DCS score (β = -0.366; P < 0.001). A higher SWD score was also associated with decreased decisional conflict (β = -0.178; P < 0.001). In conclusion, the breast cancer patients with higher levels of tamoxifen-related knowledge showed lower levels of decisional conflict regarding tamoxifen use Clinicians should provide the exact information about tamoxifen treatment to patients, based on knowledge assessment results, so as to aid patients' decision-making with minimal conflict",10.3346/jkms.2015.30.11.1604

The PSO results in complex, multiple changes of the spinopelvic alignment. The influence of the variability of individual pelvic morphology has not been fully analyzed in previous outcome studies of sagittal imbalance. The aim of this study was to define radiological variables affecting the outcome after PSO in adult spinal deformities, with special emphasis on the variability of pelvic morphology. METHODS Clinical and radiographic outcomes were analyzed in a retrospective analysis of 104 patients who underwent a PSO at a single center. The radiographic variables studied were sagittal vertical axis (SVA), T1SPI (T-1 spinopelvic inclination), lumbar lordosis (LL), thoracic kyphosis (TK), pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT), and sacral slope (SS). To control for the individual variation of pelvic morphology, the LL/PI, PT/PI, and SS/PI ratios were calculated. Clinical outcome was assessed using the visual analog scale for pain, Oswestry Disability Index, and EQ-5D preoperatively and at a minimum 1-year follow-up. Correlation coefficients were calculated between each individual radiographic variable and the outcome measures. The importance of LL mismatch to TK, reflecting the importance of a harmonious spine, was analyzed by comparing the outcome of patients with a TK+LL+PI ≤ 45° to those with a sum > 45°. RESULTS SVA and T1SPI demonstrated the strongest correlation with the clinical outcome scores (r = 0.4-0.5, p < 0.001). LL correlated weakly with the clinical outcome (r = 0.2-0.3, p < 0.003). Mismatch of LL to PI, however, did not correlate significantly with the outcome. Similarly, only weak and inconsistent correlation was observed between PT, SS, PT/PI, SS/PI, and functional outcome. Patients with a TK+LL+PI ≤ 45° had a significantly lower ODI score (33 vs 44) and a significantly higher EQ-5D score (0.64 vs 0.40) than patients with a sum > 45° (LL is a negative value). CONCLUSIONS PSO resulted in a substantial correction of sagittal imbalance and improved outcome in most patients in this study. Correction of the global sagittal balance appears to be a necessary precondition for a good outcome. A harmonious spine with a TK and an LL of similar magnitude seems to add to a positive outcome",10.3171/2016.11.SPINE16601

One of the main consequences of DAD is its negative impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The main objective of this study is to analyse the impact of using EQ-5D-5L, SF-6D(SG) (SF-6D using standard-gamble as the preference-eliciting method) and SF-6D(PG) (SF-6D using a paired-gamble method), to estimate the HRQoL burden, attributable to DAD, within the cost-of-illness framework. METHODS: A convenience sample of 109 patients with a diagnosis of substance use disorder was recruited. SF-6D and EQ-5D-5L were administered and then the utility scores were computed. The impact of employing different instruments to estimate the HRQoL burden was assessed by comparing the utility scores of patients and general population after controlling for sex and age through regression analysis. The analysis was reproduced for two subgroups of severity. RESULTS: All instruments detect that DAD significantly affects the HRQoL. However, the estimated impact changes, according to the instrument used, whose pattern varies by severity group. Nonetheless, regardless of severity, SF-6D(PG) always estimates a higher or equal DAD burden than the other instruments considered. These results are compatible with the presence of the floor effect in SF-6D(SG), the ceiling effect in EQ-ED-5L, and a smaller presence of both biases in SF-6D(PG). CONCLUSIONS: The SF-6D(PG) instrument emerges as a good candidate to avoid under-estimating intangible costs within the cost-of-illness framework. However, further research is needed to assess the validity of our results in the context of other health problems",10.1007/s10198-020-01196-7
3963,Is guideline-adherent prescribing associated with quality of life in patients with type 2 diabetes?,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/drug therapy; Female; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents/therapeutic use; Male; Middle Aged; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Quality of Life","BACKGROUND: Guideline-adherent prescribing for treatment of multiple risk factors in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients is expected to improve clinical outcomes However, the relationship to Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) is not straightforward since guideline-adherent prescribing can increase medication burden. OBJECTIVES: To test whether guideline-adherent prescribing and disease-specific medication burden are associated with HRQoL in patients with T2D. METHODS: Cross-sectional study including 1,044 T2D patients from the e-VitaDM/ZODIAC study in 2012 in the Netherlands. Data from the diabetes visit, such as laboratory and physical examinations and prescribed medication, and from two HRQoL questionnaires, the EuroQol 5 Dimensions 3 Levels (EQ5D-3L) and the World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) were collected. Twenty indicators assessing prescribing of recommended glucose lowering drugs, statins, antihypertensives and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-inhibitors and potentially inappropriate drugs from a validated diabetes indicator set were included. Disease-specific medication burden was assessed using a modified version of the Medication Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI). Associations were tested with regression models, adjusting for age, gender, diabetes duration, comorbidity, body mass index and smoking. RESULTS: The mean MRCI was 7.1, the median EQ5D-3L-score was 0.86 and the mean WHO-5 score was 72. Seven indicators included too few patients and were excluded from the analysis. The remaining thirteen indicators focusing on recommended start, intensification, current and preferred use of glucose lowering drugs, statins, antihypertensives, RAAS inhibitors, and on inappropriate prescribing of glibenclamide and dual RAAS blockade were not significantly associated with HRQoL. Finally, also the MRCI was not associated with HRQoL. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence for associations between guideline-adherent prescribing or disease-specific medication burden and HRQoL in T2D patients. This gives no rise to refrain from prescribing intensive treatment in T2D patients as recommended, but the interpretation of these results is limited by the cross-sectional study design and the selection of patients included in some indicators",10.1371/journal.pone.0202319
9953,US and UK versions of the EQ-5D preference weights: does choice of preference weights make a difference?,"Adult; Anti-HIV Agents/administration & dosage; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Delavirdine/administration & dosage; Didanosine/administration & dosage; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; HIV Infections/drug therapy/ethnology/physiopathology/psychology; Humans; Male; Patient Satisfaction; Psychometrics/instrumentation; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors; Sickness Impact Profile; United Kingdom; United States; Viral Load","BACKGROUND: Most US studies that estimate EQ-5D index score generally apply the UK preference weights. We compared the validity of a newly-developed US weights to the UK weights for use of EQ-5D as a measure of health-related quality of life. METHODS: Data were collected from a randomized clinical trial for patients with HIV (n = 1,126) in the US. Convergent validity was examined by comparing Pearson correlations of EQ-5D index scores with the MOS-HIV Health Survey scale scores and Physical and Mental Health Summary (PHS, MHS) scores using the US and UK weights. Known-groups validity of EQ-5D US versus UK index scores was compared using clinical variables (CD4+ cell count and HIV viral load), and the MOS-HIV PHS and MHS. Score changes in the EQ-5D index from baseline to week 50 were examined using effect size (ES) estimates. RESULTS: The mean EQ-5D index scores was slightly higher using US weights than UK weights (0.87 vs. 0.84, respectively). The correlation coefficient for EQ-5D utilities using the US and UK weights was 0.98. The correlations of EQ-5D index scores with the MOS-HIV scores were moderate and similar using the US and UK weights. The EQ-5D index scores discriminated equally well for both versions between levels of CD4+ count, HIV viral load, and PHS and MHS scores (P < 0.05), suggesting equivalent known-groups validity. The changes in EQ-5D index scores from baseline to week 50 were similar for both versions (ES: 0.21 vs. 0.22 for US and UK, respectively), suggesting equivalent responsiveness to score changes. CONCLUSIONS: EQ-5D index scores generated using UK and US preference weights showed equivalent psychometric properties. For assessing treatment benefit in a single population, the use of either the UK or US weights as a measure of HRQOL will not change inferences. However, for comparisons across US and UK populations, the choice between these two weights should be based on their relevance to the study population",10.1007/s11136-007-9206-4

Presenteeism, the practice of working at reduced potential, is more harmful than absenteeism. Present workers most often experience musculoskeletal pain that is not mitigated by general exercise or stretching. We aimed to assess whether a regimen of pain neuroscience education (PNE) and exercise tailored to individual healthcare workers could reduce presenteeism and improve productivity. METHODS: An independent investigator randomized 104 medical professionals into two groups (intervention and control). The control group received general feedback after answering a questionnaire, while the intervention group received a 6-month plan of exercises and PNE created by a physical therapist with 10 years of experience. Our primary outcome was the scores of the Japanese version of the World Health Organization Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (WHO-HPQ) to investigate presenteeism; and our secondary outcomes were pain intensity, widespread pain index (WPI), and EuroQol 5-dimension (EQ5D-5L). RESULTS: In the intervention group, post intervention, we observed significant improvement in presenteeism, pain intensity, WPI, physical and psychological stress, and EQ5D-5L (P < .05). In the control group, we noted significant improvement only in the physical and psychological stress post intervention (P < .05). The results showed significant between-group differences in presenteeism post-intervention (P < .05).

PROMs help to get a better understanding what is meaningful to a patient and directly affects daily functioning. To move beyond traditional measures, we are interested in what matters to patients and developed this project. The aim of this article is to provide the protocol for our study collecting PROMs in daily medical practice from patients who undergo knee arthroplasty. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a single-site, observational, prospective cohort study. We will recruit patients scheduled for a knee arthroplasty in our medical office, situated in a private clinic. After signed informed consent, patients complete self-reported questionnaires before the surgery, after 4 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years. We will use the following PROMs: Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Forgotten Joint Score, EuroQol five dimensions and satisfaction. Additionally, the surgeon will complete the objective Knee Society Score. Administration of the questionnaires will be electronically or paper-based. We will assess differences between preoperative and postoperative data with paired t-test for continuous variables and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for categorical variables. To assess subgroup differences, we will use unpaired t-test for continuous variables and Mann-Whitney U test for categorical variables. To assess possible presence of bias, we will conduct sensitivity analyses. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been reviewed and approved by the local ethics committee in Basel, Switzerland. Written informed consent will be obtained from all patients. We will disseminate the results of the study through peer-reviewed journals, national and international conference presentations and presentations to relevant stakeholders through appropriate channels",10.1136/bmjopen-2020-040811
1822,Treatment of Periprosthetic Joint Infection and Fracture-Related Infection With a Temporary Arthrodesis Made by PMMA-Coated Intramedullary Nails - Evaluation of Technique and Quality of Life in Implant-Free Interval,coated implants; fracture-related infection; periprosthetic joint infection; polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA); psychological outcomes; quality of life; temporary arthrodesis,"BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial coating of intramedullary nails with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement promises infection control and stabilization for subsequent bone healing. However, when removing the implant, bone cement can debond and remain in the medullary cavity of the long bones, representing a nidus for reinfection. This work presents a technique comprising reinforcement of PMMA-coated intramedullary nails with cerclage wire to prevent such problems in patients treated for fracture-related infection (FRI) or knee periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) with a static spacer as temporary arthrodesis allowing weight-bearing in the implant-free interval. Outcomes of this surgical treatment were evaluated in terms of (i) associated complications and (ii) patient-reported quality of life. METHODS: In this retrospective case series, 20 patients with PJI (n = 14, 70%) and FRI (n = 6, 30%) treated with PMMA-coated intramedullary nails reinforced with cerclage wire between January 2021 and July 2021 were included Quality of life during the implant-free interval was evaluated with the EQ-5D, SF-36, and an ICD-10 based psychological symptom rating and compared with previously analyzed cohorts of successfully treated PJI and FRI patients in whom eradication of infection and stable bone consolidation was achieved. RESULTS: Complications during the implant-free interval comprised a broken nail in one case (5.0%) and a reinfection in one case (5.0%). Coating-specific side effects and cement debonding during removal did not occur. The mean physical health component score of SF-36 was 26.1 ± 7.6, and the mean mental health component score reached a value of 47.1 ± 18.6. The mean EQ-5D index value was 0.36 ± 0.32 and the mean EQ-5D visual analogue scale rating was 47.4 ± 19.4. The scores were significantly lower than those in the successfully treated FRI cohort but not in the PJI cohort. The mean ICD-10-based symptom rating scores revealed psychological symptom burden on the depression scale and enhanced levels of anxiety in comparison with healed FRI and PJI patients. CONCLUSION: Reinforcement of PMMA bone cement-coated implants seems to be a reasonable treatment option to create a temporary arthrodesis, preventing detachment of the bone cement when the implant was removed.Level of Evidence: IV",10.3389/fsurg.2022.917696

METHODS: We searched randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors (nivolumab, pembrolizumab, atezolizumab, avelumab, or durvalumab) with standard-of-care therapy in patients with advanced cancer reporting PROs with generic measures: the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 items (QLQ-C30) and the EuroQol Five Dimensions Questionnaire. The summary outcomes were changes in PROs from baseline to follow-up within and between treatment groups and time to deterioration (TTD) in PROs based on clinically meaningful change. RESULTS: A total of 6,334 patients from 13 RCTs were included: six nivolumab, five pembrolizumab, and two atezolizumab trials. For the QLQ-C30 global health status/quality of life, the pooled difference in mean change between treatment groups was 5.1 (95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3-6.9; p < .001) favoring PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. The pooled mean change from baseline in PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and controls was 0.1 (95% CI, -2.2, 2.5) and - 6.1 (95% CI, -8.4, -3.8), respectively. The TTD was significantly longer with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, with a hazard ratio of 0.72 (95% CI, 0.55-0.93; p = .011). Similarly, significantly better outcomes were noted with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors on most of the other PRO measures. CONCLUSION: PD1/PD-L1 inhibitors maintained health-related quality of life to a greater degree and had less worsening in symptoms than standard-of-care therapy even though patients on these immune modulators were on treatment longer. The better PRO profile further supports the clinical benefit of this treatment strategy for advanced cancer. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare patient-reported outcomes (PROs) of programmed death receptor-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-1/PD-L1) inhibitors and standard-of-care therapy in patients with advanced cancer. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were associated with consistently smaller PRO score deterioration from baseline to follow-up for different health-related quality-of-life and symptoms scales. In addition, the time to deterioration in multiple PRO domains was significantly longer with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Taken together, these findings indicate that the patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors maintained health-related quality of life to a greater degree and had less symptom burden compared with those treated with standard-of-care therapy",10.1634/theoncologist.2018-0449

METHODS: We assessed 180-day mortality and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) using EuroQoL (EQ)-5D-5L index values and EQ visual analogue scale (VAS) in the international, stratified, blinded COVID STEROID 2 trial, which randomised 1000 adults with confirmed COVID-19 receiving at least 10 L/min of oxygen or mechanical ventilation in 26 hospitals in Europe and India. In the HRQoL analyses, higher values indicated better outcomes, and deceased patients were given a score of zero. RESULTS: We obtained vital status at 180 days for 963 of 982 patients (98.1%) in the intention-to-treat population, EQ-5D-5L index value data for 922 (93.9%) and EQ VAS data for 924 (94.1%). At 180 days, 164 of 486 patients (33.7%) had died in the 12 mg group versus 184 of 477 (38.6%) in the 6 mg group [adjusted risk difference - 4.3%; 99% confidence interval (CI) - 11.7-3.0; relative risk 0.89; 0.72-1.09; P = 0.13]. The adjusted mean differences between the 12 mg and the 6 mg groups in EQ-5D-5L index values were 0.06 (99% CI - 0.01 to 0.12; P = 0.10) and in EQ VAS scores 4 (- 3 to 10; P = 0.22). CONCLUSION: Among patients with COVID-19 and severe hypoxaemia, dexamethasone 12 mg compared with 6 mg did not result in statistically significant improvements in mortality or HRQoL at 180 days, but the results were most compatible with benefit from the higher dose",10.1007/s00134-022-06677-2
7929,Use of conservative therapy before and after surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome,Carpal Tunnel Syndrome/surgery; Conservative Treatment; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Retrospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Treatment Outcome; Carpal tunnel release; Carpal tunnel syndrome; Conservative therapy; Rehabilitation,"BACKGROUND: Conservative therapies are typically offered to individuals who experience mild or intermittent symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) or postoperatively to subjects who have undergone carpal tunnel release. Although long-term studies report mostly positive results for carpal tunnel release, knowledge on the need for conservative treatments following surgery is scarce The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to examine the use of conservative therapies before and after carpal tunnel releasing surgery. METHODS: Of 528 patients who underwent carpal tunnel release surgery in the study hospital during the study period, 259 provided sufficiently completed questionnaires (response rate 49 %). The patients completed a questionnaire battery including a sociodemographic, medical history and symptom questionnaire, the Boston Carpal Tunnel Syndrome Questionnaire, 6-item CTS symptoms scale and EuroQoL 5D Frequencies of conservative therapies pre- and postoperatively were calculated Association between Pain VAS and satisfaction with treatment were examined in patient groups according to the use of conservative therapies. RESULTS: Of all patients, 41 (16 %) reported receiving only preoperative, 18 (7 %) reported receiving only postoperative, 157 (60 %) reported receiving both pre- and postoperative conservative therapies and 43 (17 %) did not receive any therapies Preoperative use of conservative therapies was more common in females than males (82 % vs. 64 %; p = 0.002), but postoperatively no significant gender difference was observed. The patients who received conservative therapies were younger than non-users in both the preoperative (median age 59 vs. 66; p < 0.001) and postoperative (59 vs. 66; p = 0.04) phases. The patients reported high satisfaction with their treatment and simultaneous improvement in Pain VAS scores. Those receiving conservative therapies only preoperatively reported the highest satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: While the use of conservative therapies decreased after surgery, a large proportion of the patients received these adjunct interventions. Patients reported high satisfaction with their treatment one year post surgery. Pain outcome seems to be closely related to satisfaction with treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the utility before and 1 year after elective spine surgery with some other common orthopaedic surgical procedures. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: By using global measures like EQ-5D and SF-36 for the determination of the utility, the changes in quality of life, quality of life (QoL) after an intervention different diagnoses, and treatments can be compared. Total hip replacement (THR) has become almost golden standard in this respect. METHODS: Seven hundred seventy-seven subjects with different common orthopaedic diagnoses scheduled for elective surgery were just before surgery and 1 year after surgery answering both EQ-5D and SF-36. Four groups with different spine diagnoses and procedures were formed and compared with 8 other diagnoses and treatment groups. RESULTS: Before surgery, subjects with spine diagnoses reported the lowest QoL of all diagnoses compared. Surgery for spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and instability meant the largest improvement of all surgical interventions. Surgery for NHP gave a moderately good improvement, whereas surgery for CLBP only marginally improved those operated. Particularly THR but also TKR more or less completely normalized QoL but made it from a relatively high preoperative level. The greatest improvements after spine surgery, other surgical procedures, and different diagnoses were in the pain/discomfort domain. CONCLUSION: Spinal surgery in spinal stenosis, spondylolisthesis, and instability had in comparison to other types of elective orthopaedic surgery an outstanding better ability to improve the operated subject's health-related quality of life than other types of elective orthopaedic surgery. The utility of HNP surgery was somewhat lower and was rather marginal for those operated for nonspecific CLBP",10.1097/BRS.0b013e31818e2914

METHODS: The case series consisted of 10 patients diagnosed with osteoid osteoma of the hip, who were treated by arthroscopic nidus removal. An endoscopic gamma probe was used intraoperatively to locate the nidus and to control the extent of its removal. Residual osteoma cavities were additionally treated with an arthroscopic radiofrequency ablator Microfracturing was performed when the osteochondral defect was in the weight-bearing area and osteochondroplasty was done in cases of concomitant cam deformity. Nonarthritic Hip Score (NAHS), Tegner activity score, quality of life questionnaire (EQ-5D) and postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used for evaluation before and post-surgery, with a minimum follow-up of 2 years RESULTS: The relative reduction of the gamma irradiation count immediately after removal of the nidus was 44.9% (range 33.3-54.5%). Postoperatively, all patients experienced prompt pain relief and a significant improvement according to all patient reported outcomes. Control MRI revealed fibro-cartilaginous tissue repair of post-osteoma osteochondral defects in the weight-bearing area; 1 patient showed signs of early degeneration. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this case series demonstrated the safety and high efficacy of gamma-probe-assisted arthroscopic removal of the osteoid osteoma from the hip joint. Endoscopic gamma probe was recognised as a very useful device for locating the nidus of the osteoid osteoma exactly and preventing incomplete or excessive removal of the bone",10.1177/1120700018782274

Patients with diabetes are more likely to exhibit poor mental health which negatively affects treatment outcomes. However, patients with high levels of social support (SS) are likely to report optimal mental health. We sought to determine how SS affects the report of psychiatric morbidity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 108 diabetic patients in Harare, Zimbabwe. RESULTS: The average age of participants was 54.1 (SD 18.6) years. Most of the participants were; females (69.4%), married (51.9%), and were of low level of income (43.5%). 37.1% of the participants exhibited signs of psychiatric morbidity [mean Shona Symptoms Questionnaire score-6.7 (SD 3.2)]. Further, patients also reported lower HRQoL [mean EQ-5D-VAS score-64.1 (SD 15.3)] and high levels of SS [mean Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support score-43.7 (SD 11.5)]. Patients who received greater amount of SS had optimal mental health Being female, unmarried, lower education attainment, having more comorbid conditions, being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and having been diagnosed of diabetes for a longer duration were associated with poorer mental health. It is important to develop context-specific interventions to improve diabetic patients' mental health",10.1186/s13104-018-3881-9

METHODS: Patients ≥40 years of age with symptomatic, irreparable, posterosuperior, massive rotator cuff tears and an intact subscapularis who underwent failed nonoperative management were included in this randomized controlled trial comparing the InSpace implant with partial repair Clinical outcome data were collected at baseline through a 24-month follow-up The primary outcome was improvement in the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores. The secondary outcomes included change from baseline in the Western Ontario Rotator Cuff (WORC) score, the visual analog scale (VAS) pain score, the Constant-Murley shoulder score, the EuroQol-5 Dimensions-5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) score, active range of motion, and operative time. Complications and reoperations for each group were also recorded. RESULTS: Twenty sites randomized 184 patients: 93 in the InSpace group and 91 in the partial repair group Significant and clinically relevant improvements in the ASES score from baseline were noted in both groups at Month 12 and were maintained at Month 24. Overall, 83% of patients in the InSpace group and 81% of patients in the partial repair group achieved the ASES minimally clinically important difference threshold, and 82% of patients in the InSpace group and 79% of patients in the partial repair group achieved the substantial clinical benefit threshold. Forward elevation was significantly greater in the InSpace group compared with the partial repair group at Day 10 (p = 0.04), Week 6 (p = 0.0001), Month 12 (p = 0.005), and Month 24 (p = 0.003). The operative time was significantly shorter in the InSpace group (p < 0.0001). No device-related surgical complications were noted, and 4 reoperations after InSpace implantation and 3 reoperations after partial repair were required CONCLUSIONS: The InSpace implant is an appropriate alternative to partial repair in patients with irreparable posterosuperior massive rotator cuff tears and an intact subscapularis. Notable benefits include early functional recovery and pain relief combined with a shorter operative time. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic Level I .

MATERIAL AND METHOD: We analyzed quality of life using the EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. This questionnaire evaluates mobility, personal care, daily activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression and a self-rating scale of the health condition. We compared the result with demographic variables (gender, age, work situation, studies, income, partner) and clinical variables (ASA classification, tumor stage, time since cystectomy was performed, adjuvant chemotherapy, recurrent and complications of the stoma). The statistical analysis included a descriptive study, univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were included in the study, with a mean age of 69 years (47-84). Mean time from cystectomy was 43 months (12-83), with 61% complications associated to the stoma Stoma complications were related with limitations in personal care, pain/discomfort, anxiety, depression and quality of life in general. Female gender was associated with limitations in daily activities and adjuvant chemotherapy with anxiety/depression and quality of life in general. The rest of the variables were not statistically significant in the multivariate analysis CONCLUSIONS: The limitations in quality of life in patients with cystectomy and ileal conduit are associated with the stoma-associated complications. Other related variables are female gender and administration of adjuvant chemotherapy",10.1016/j.acuro.2013.04.006

The proportion of patients having a second surgery within 2 years varies in the literature between 0.5% and 24%, with recurrent herniation being the most common cause. Several studies have not found any relevant outcome differences between patients undergoing surgery for primary LDH and patients undergoing reoperation for a recurrent LDH, but these studies have limitations, including small sample size and retrospective design. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We (1) compared patient-reported outcomes between patients operated on for primary LDH and patients reoperated on for recurrent LDH within 1 year after index surgery and (2) determined risk factors for worse outcomes. METHODS: We obtained data from the Swedish National Spine Register, Swespine, where patient-reported outcomes are collected using mailed protocols at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years after surgery. Of the 13,562 patients identified who underwent LDH between January 2000 and May 2011, 13,305 (98%) underwent primary surgery for LDH and 257 (2%) underwent reoperation for a recurrent LDH within the first year. Patient-reported outcomes at 1 to 2 years were available for 8497 patients (63%), 8350 of 13,305 (63%) in the primary LDH group and 147 of 257 (57%) in the recurrent LDH group (p = 0.068). We compared leg and back pain (VAS: 0-100), function (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]: 0-100), quality of life (EQ-5D: -0.59 to 1.0), patient satisfaction, and global assessment of leg pain between groups. We also analyzed rsik factors for worse global assessment and satisfaction. RESULTS: Mean (95% CI) differences in improvement between groups favoring patients with primary LDH were VAS leg pain 9 (4-14), ODI 6 (3-9), and EQ-5D 0.09 (0.04-0.15). While statistically significant, these effect sizes may be lower than the minimal clinically important differences often referred to. Percentage of satisfied patients was 79% and 58% in the primary and recurrent LDH groups, respectively (p < 0.001), and percentage of patients with no or better leg pain (global assessment) was 74% and 65%, respectively (p = 0.008). Reoperation for recurrent LDH represented the largest independent risk for dissatisfaction; this factor and smoking represented similar risks for less improvement in leg pain. CONCLUSIONS: Repeat surgery for a recurrent LDH was performed with good probability for improvement, although not as good as for primary LDH surgery, and patients undergoing repeated surgery were less satisfied. Studies on risk factors for recurrence are warranted. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level II, therapeutic study.

Increasing proportions of negative side effects due to extensive pharmacological treatment are however observed especially among elderly patients who have multiple health problems. The aim of our study was to see if there is an association between medication quality and quality of life. METHODS: 150 patients discharged from hospital. Inclusion criteria were: living in ordinary homes, ≥ 75 years and ≥ 5 drugs. Home visits were performed to all, including prescription reviews and calculation of medication appropriateness index. The patients were divided into three groups depending on index score and followed for 12 months The validated and recognized EQ-5D and EQ VAS instruments were used to assess quality of life. RESULTS: A lower medication quality was associated with a lower quality of life. EQ-5D index was statistically significantly different (declining for each group) among the groups (p = 0.001 at study start, p = 0.001 at 6 months and p = 0.013 at 12 months) as was EQ VAS (p = 0.026 at study start, p = 0.003 at 6 months and p = 0.007 at 12 months). CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown the validity of the basic principle in prescribing: the more appropriate medication the better quality of life. Since drug quality is related to the patients' quality of life, there is immense reason to continuously evaluate every prescription and treatment. The evaluation and if possible deprescribing should be done as a process where both the patient and physician are involved",10.1186/1477-7525-9-95

This study evaluated the effects of a 10-day cycle of pelotherapy at the spa centre 'El Raposo' (Spain) in a group of 21 OA patients diagnosed with primary knee OA. Clinical assessments included pain intensity using a visual analog scale; pain, stiffness and physical function using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index; and health-related quality of life using the EuroQol-5D questionnaire. Serum inflammatory cytokine levels (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-β) were evaluated using the Bio-Plex® Luminex® system. Circulating neuroendocrine-stress biomarkers, such as cortisol and extracellular 72 kDa heat shock protein (eHsp72), were measured by ELISA. After the cycle of mud therapy, OA patients improved the knee flexion angle and OA-related pain, stiffness and physical function, and they reported a better health-related quality of life. Serum concentrations of IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-6 and TGF-β, as well as eHsp72, were markedly decreased. Besides, systemic levels of cortisol increased significantly These results confirm that the clinical benefits of mud therapy may well be mediated, at least in part, by its systemic anti-inflammatory effects and neuroendocrine-immune regulation in OA patients. Thus, mud therapy could be an effective alternative treatment in the management of OA",10.1007/s00484-017-1361-x

METHODS: Patient-reported outcomes were assessed at baseline, day 1 of each cycle, and end of treatment. General health status was measured using the EuroQol-5D visual analog scale and health utility index scores were assessed using the EuroQol-5D descriptive system. Functioning, lung cancer symptoms, and global quality of life (QOL) were assessed using European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-LC13 lung cancer module Repeated measures mixed-effects analyses compared overall scores and change from baseline scores, controlling for baseline scores. RESULTS: The overall mean EQ-5D health utility index scores (95% CI) on treatment were significantly greater (p < 0.05) for crizotinib (0.82 [0.79-0.85]) than for chemotherapy (0.73 [0.70-0.77]; 0.74 [0.70-0.79] for pemetrexed and 0.66 [0.58-0.74] for docetaxel). A significantly greater improvement from baseline was observed with crizotinib versus pemetrexed and versus docetaxel treatment groups for general health status, physical functioning, global QOL, dyspnea, fatigue, and pain. Improvement rates for fatigue, cough, pain, dyspnea, and global QOL were significantly greater on crizotinib compared with pemetrexed and docetaxel, respectively Worsening rates for diarrhea and constipation were higher with crizotinib CONCLUSION: The benefits of crizotinib in improving symptoms and QOL are demonstrated regardless of whether the comparator is pemetrexed or docetaxel",10.1097/JTO.0000000000000318
6511,Development and Validation of the Long Coronavirus Disease (COVID) Symptom and Impact Tools: A Set of Patient-Reported Instruments Constructed From Patients' Lived Experience,Adult; COVID-19/complications; Female; Humans; Male; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; SARS-CoV-2; Surveys and Questionnaires; COVID-19; long COVID; patient-reported outcome,"BACKGROUND: To develop and validate patient-reported instruments, based on patients' lived experiences, for monitoring the symptoms and impact of long coronavirus disease (covid). METHODS: The long covid Symptom and Impact Tools (ST and IT) were constructed from the answers to a survey with open-ended questions to 492 patients with long COVID. Validation of the tools involved adult patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and symptoms extending over 3 weeks after onset. Construct validity was assessed by examining the relations of the ST and IT scores with health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), function (PCFS, post-COVID functional scale), and perceived health (MYMOP2, Measure yourself medical outcome profile 2). Reliability was determined by a test-retest. The ""patient acceptable symptomatic state"" (PASS) was determined by the percentile method. RESULTS: Validation involved 1022 participants (55% with confirmed COVID-19, 79% female, and 12.5% hospitalized for COVID-19). The long COVID ST and IT scores were strongly correlated with the EQ-5D-5L (rs = -0.45 and rs = -0.59, respectively), the PCFS (rs = -0.39 and rs = -0.55), and the MYMOP2 (rs = -0.40 and rs = -0.59). Reproducibility was excellent with an interclass correlation coefficient of 0.83 (95% confidence interval .80 to .86) for the ST score and 0.84 (.80 to .87) for the IT score. In total, 793 (77.5%) patients reported an unacceptable symptomatic state, thereby setting the PASS for the long covid IT score at 30 (28 to 33). CONCLUSIONS: The long covid ST and IT tools, constructed from patients' lived experiences, provide the first validated and reliable instruments for monitoring the symptoms and impact of long covid",10.1093/cid/ciab352
7728,Cost-Effectiveness of Two Dry Needling Interventions for Plantar Heel Pain: A Secondary Analysis of an RCT,"Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dry Needling; Fasciitis, Plantar; Heel; Humans; Pain; Pain Measurement; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; cost-effectiveness analysis; dry needling; percutaneous needle electrolysis; plantar heel pain; quality of life","Plantar heel pain is a common cause of foot pain that affects patients' quality of life and represents a significant cost for the healthcare system. Dry needling and percutaneous needle electrolysis are two minimally invasive treatments that were shown to be effective for the management of plantar heel pain. The aim of our study was to compare these two treatments in terms of health and economic consequences based on the results of a published randomized controlled trial. For this, we evaluated the costs from the point of view of the hospital and we carried out a cost-effectiveness study using quality of life as the main variable according to the Eq-5D-5L questionnaire. The cost of the complete treatment with dry needling (DN) was €178.86, while the percutaneous needle electrolysis (PNE) was €200.90. The quality of life of patients improved and was translated into +0.615 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for DN and +0.669 for PNE. PNE presented an average incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €411.34/QALY against DN. These results indicate that PNE had a better cost-effectiveness ratio for the treatment of plantar heel pain than DN",10.3390/ijerph18041777

METHODS: An expert panel of eye health professionals was convened to agree current glaucoma practice in Tanzania. In addition a structured patient survey was developed and administered. Supplemental cost and quality of life information was collected using cost questionnaires and validated quality of life measures, including the EQ5D and VFQ-25. RESULTS: Key findings include following. Non-adherence is a major issue, especially in rural settings where over 50% of the patients may fail to return for review. Whilst medical therapy is overwhelmingly the first line treatment, the cost of maintaining this represents up to 25% of a patient's income. There is an impact of glaucoma on patients general well-being as determined by the EQ-5D and more tellingly on visual function with particular impact on role limitations as determined by the VF25 Despite our sample being taken in a private clinic and thus containing a much larger proportion of professionals than the general population, one third of the population earned Tanzanian Shillings (TZS) 170,000 per month which is below the minimum wage. CONCLUSION: These findings are of great importance for health care planners seeking to determine cost-effective, acceptable methods of both identifying and treating this major cause of preventable blindness",10.1371/journal.pone.0232796
8582,The impact of depression on health-related quality of life and wellbeing: identifying important dimensions and assessing their inclusion in multi-attribute utility instruments,"Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Depression/psychology; Depressive Disorder/psychology; Female; Happiness; Health Status; Healthy Volunteers/psychology; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Quality of Life/psychology; Self Concept; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; Capability wellbeing; Depression; Health-related quality of life; Multi-attribute utility; Subjective wellbeing","PURPOSE: Wellbeing measures have been proposed for inclusion in economic evaluation to measure the effect of depression and compensate for shortcomings of existing multi-attribute utility instruments (MAUIs). The aims of this study were to identify dimensions of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and wellbeing that are most affected by depression and to examine the extent to which these are captured by MAUIs. METHODS: Data were used from the Multi-Instrument Comparison study. Dimensions of HRQoL (SF-36v2 and AQoL-8D dimensions), capability wellbeing (ICECAP-A), and subjective wellbeing (including PWI, SWLS, and IHS) were identified that distinguished most individuals with depression from a healthy public. The extent to which these dimensions explain the content of five existing MAUIs (15D, AQoL-8D, EQ-5D-5L, HUI-3, and SF-6D) was examined using regression analyses. Additionally, the sensitivity of all MAUIs was also assessed towards depression-specific symptoms measured by DASS-21 and K-10. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 917 individuals with self-reported depression and 1760 healthy subjects. Dimensions that distinguished most individuals with depression from the healthy group (effect size > 2) included AQoL-8D coping, AQoL-8D happiness, AQoL-8D self-worth, ICECAP-A, SF-36 mental health, and SF-36 social functioning The AQoL-8D was most sensitive to the dimensions above as well as towards the depression-specific measures, the K10, DASS-S, and DASS-D. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that psychosocial dimensions of HRQoL have the greatest ability to capture the impact of depression when compared with dimensions of capability wellbeing and SWB. Some MAUIs, such as the AQoL-8D, are sensitive to most distinguishing dimensions of HRQoL and wellbeing, which may obviate the need for supplementary wellbeing instruments",10.1007/s11136-018-1936-y
1376,A retrospective comparative cohort study of the effects of neural mobilization (NM) alone and NM combined with transcranial direct current stimulation in patients with cervical radiculopathy,Cervical Vertebrae; Cohort Studies; Humans; Pain; Quality of Life; Radiculopathy/therapy; Retrospective Studies; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Treatment Outcome; Cervical radiculopathy (CR); neural mobilization (NM); neuromodulation; retrospective observational study; transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),"BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and neural mobilization (NM) are widely used in clinical practice as two effective treatment. However, there have existed few studies of the combination of these two treatments, particularly in cervical radiculopathy (CR). To explore the value of combined tDCS and NM for the management of pain, disability, and quality of life (QoL) in patients with CR, authors designed this study. METHODS: According to certain inclusion criteria, 36 subjects were selected from 224 patients with CR enrolled in Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital between June 2021 and December 2021. Subjects were divided into two groups based on the treatment they had already received at the hospital. Patients in the combined tDCS group received tDCS and NM therapy, while patients in the NM group received NM therapy alone. Visual analog scale (VAS), Neck Disability Index (NDI), and EuroQuol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) scores were assessed at baseline, immediately after treatment, and at the 4-week follow-up to evaluate pain, neck disability, and the QoL of patients. SPSS 22.0 software (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) is used as main tool for data analysis. RESULTS: A total of 36 patients were enrolled (19 in the combined tDCS group and 17 in the NM group). The baseline VAS, NDI, and EQ-5D scores in the combined tDCS group were 54.3±16.4 mm, 35.1±14.7, and 0.62±0.15, respectively, while the baseline VAS, NDI, and EQ-5D scores in the NM group were 54.0±16.5 mm, 31.8±12.8, and 0.64±0.15, respectively. There was no significant difference in baseline data between the two groups. At the 4-week post-treatment follow-up, the VAS score was significantly lower in the combined tDCS group than in the NM group (24.5±16.1 and 40.7±17.3 mm, respectively, P=0.008), and the NDI was also significantly lower in the combined tDCS group than in the NM group (16.1±11.5 vs. 26.6±17.7, P=0.045). There was no significant difference between the combined tDCS and NM groups in EQ-5D (0.75±0.15 vs. 0.69±0.09, P=0.192) CONCLUSIONS: Compared with NM therapy alone, combined tDCS and NM therapy may play a role in pain relief and neck disability improvement in CR patients",10.21037/apm-22-746

METHODS: Data were collected from two surveys conducted alongside a clinical trial: the arthroscopy sample and the general practitioner (GP) sample. The effect size (ES) was used to assess responsiveness Anchor-based minimal change included minimal clinical important difference (MCID) and receiver operator characteristic curves; standardized error of measurement and minimal detectable change (MDC) was employed for distribution-based approaches. The KQoL-26 results are compared with those for the Lysholm Knee Score, EQ-5D and SF-36. RESULTS: The arthroscopy sample consisted of 121 participants and the GP sample of 218 participants at baseline. The largest ES was found for the KQoL-26 emotional functioning scale in both samples. The results were in favour of the condition-specific instrument. The MCID for KQoL-26 physical functioning, activities limitations and emotional functioning scales were 3, 15 and 18, respectively, in the arthroscopy sample; they were 11, 16 and 24 in the GP sample. The MDC 95 % was estimated as 18, 28 and 34, and 15, 24 and 30 in each sample, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The KQoL-26 emotional functional scale was the most responsive of all scales. It is recommended that an instrument such as the KQoL-26 that includes emotional functioning should be included rather than the Lysholm in future clinical trials of patients with suspected internal derangement of the knee",10.1007/s11136-012-0298-0

Precontoured clavicle plates may decrease hardware-related complications while improving healing rates and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). METHODS: Using a private-payer national database, we identified 7826 patients who underwent clavicle open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) in 2007 to 2011. Database patients were tracked for 2 years to assess hardware removal and revision fixation. In addition, we retrospectively identified 73 patients who underwent plate fixation of midshaft clavicular fractures at our institution. These patients completed the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) assessment, the EQ-5D (EuroQol, Rotterdam, The Netherlands) quality of life assessment, and a hardware-related outcomes survey. RESULTS: Among 7826 database patients, 994 (12.7%) underwent hardware removal and 78 (1%) required revision ORIF. The annual incidence of clavicle ORIF increased 61.5% between 2007 and 2011. In our institutional cohort, 56 patients (77%) were fixed with precontoured plates and 17 (23%) with standard plates. At a mean follow-up of 4.2 years, 11 patients (15%) underwent hardware removal and 1 patient (1.4%) experienced nonunion. Patients reported excellent outcomes, with average DASH of 4.0 ± 8.9 and EQ-5D of 0.89 ± 0.19. There were no differences in PROs, hardware removal, or union rate between plate types, although our study was underpowered for these outcomes. Patients who underwent hardware removal reported lower DASH, EQ-5D, satisfaction, and shoulder function compared with patients with hardware retained. Women were more likely to undergo hardware removal in the institutional (P = .009) and the database (P < .001) cohorts. CONCLUSION: Displaced midshaft clavicle fractures have high union rates with precontoured plate fixation. Women are 4 times more likely than men to have hardware removed. Patients undergoing clavicle hardware removal report worse long-term outcomes than patients with hardware retained",10.1016/j.jse.2015.09.029
9794,Informal Caregiving in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS): A High Caregiver Burden and Drastic Consequences on Caregivers' Lives,amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); anxiety; caregiver burden; decreasing autonomy; depression; functional status; health-related quality of life; informal caregiving; psychological support; socioeconomic status,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that causes progressive autonomy loss and need for care. This does not only affect patients themselves, but also the patients' informal caregivers (CGs) in their health, personal and professional lives. The big efforts of this multi-center study were not only to evaluate the caregivers' burden and to identify its predictors, but it also should provide a specific understanding of the needs of ALS patients' CGs and fill the gap of knowledge on their personal and work lives Using standardized questionnaires, primary data from patients and their main informal CGs (n = 249) were collected. Patients' functional status and disease severity were evaluated using the Barthel Index, the revised Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R) and the King's Stages for ALS. The caregivers' burden was recorded by the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI). Comorbid anxiety and depression of caregivers were assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Additionally, the EuroQol Five Dimension Five Level Scale evaluated their health-related quality of life. The caregivers' burden was high (mean ZBI = 26/88, 0 = no burden, ≥24 = highly burdened) and correlated with patients' functional status (r(p) = -0.555, p < 0.001, n = 242). It was influenced by the CGs' own mental health issues due to caregiving (+11.36, 95% CI [6.84; 15.87], p < 0.001), patients' wheelchair dependency (+9.30, 95% CI [5.94; 12.66], p < 0.001) and was interrelated with the CGs' depression (r(p) = 0.627, p < 0.001, n = 234), anxiety (r(p) = 0.550, p < 0.001, n = 234), and poorer physical condition (r(p) = -0.362, p < 0.001, n = 237). Moreover, female CGs showed symptoms of anxiety more often, which also correlated with the patients' impairment in daily routine (r(s) = -0.280, p < 0.001, n = 169). As increasing disease severity, along with decreasing autonomy, was the main predictor of caregiver burden and showed to create relevant (negative) implications on CGs' lives, patient care and supportive therapies should address this issue. Moreover, in order to preserve the mental and physical health of the CGs, new concepts of care have to focus on both, on not only patients but also their CGs and gender-associated specific issues. As caregiving in ALS also significantly influences the socioeconomic status by restrictions in CGs' work lives and income, and the main reported needs being lack of psychological support and a high bureaucracy, the situation of CGs needs more attention. Apart from their own multi-disciplinary medical and psychological care, more support in care and patient management issues is required",10.3390/brainsci11060748

Respiratory muscle weakness following spinal cord injury-induced tetraplegia impairs lung function and the ability to cough. In particular, inspiratory muscle strength has been identified as the best predictor of the likelihood of developing pneumonia in individuals with tetraplegia. We hypothesised that 6 weeks of progressive respiratory muscle training (RMT) increases respiratory muscle strength with improvements in lung function, quality of life and respiratory health. METHODS: Sixty-two adults with tetraplegia participated in a double-blind randomised controlled trial. Active or sham RMT was performed twice daily for 6 weeks Inspiratory muscle strength, measured as maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included lung function, quality of life and respiratory health. Between-group comparisons were obtained with linear models adjusting for baseline values of the outcomes. RESULTS: After 6 weeks, there was a greater improvement in PImax in the active group than in the sham group (mean difference 11.5 cmH(2)O (95% CI 5.6 to 17.4), p<0.001) and respiratory symptoms were reduced (St George Respiratory Questionnaire mean difference 10.3 points (0.01-20.65), p=0.046). Significant improvements were observed in quality of life (EuroQol-Five Dimensional Visual Analogue Scale 14.9 points (1.9-27.9), p=0.023) and perceived breathlessness (Borg score 0.64 (0.11-1.17), p=0.021). There were no significant improvements in other measures of respiratory function (p=0.126-0.979). CONCLUSIONS: Progressive RMT increases inspiratory muscle strength in people with tetraplegia, by a magnitude which is likely to be clinically significant. Measurement of baseline PImax and provision of RMT to at-risk individuals may reduce respiratory complications after tetraplegia.

However, data on the impact of obesity levels on patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) is sparse. We investigated the association between different obesity classes with PROMs among patients who underwent TKA. METHODS: We performed retrospective secondary analyses on data extracted from the total joint replacement data repository (Alberta, Canada) managed by the Alberta Bone and Joint Health Institute (ABJHI) Patients had WOMAC and EQ5D scores measured at baseline in addition to 3 and/or 12 months following TKA. Patients were stratified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, into five body mass index (BMI) groups of normal, overweight, BMI class I, BMI class II, and BMI class III. The association between BMI and mean changes in WOMAC subscales (pain, function, and stiffness) and EQ-5D-5L index over the time intervals of baseline to 3 months and 3 to 12 months following TKA was assessed. Linear mixed-effects models were used, and the models were adjusted for age, sex, length of surgery, comorbidities, year of surgery, and geographical zone where the surgery was performed. RESULTS: Mean age was 65.5 years (SD = 8.7). Postoperatively, there was a significant improvement (p < 0.001) in WOMAC subscales of patient-reported pain, function, and stiffness, as well as EQ-5D-5L regardless of BMI group. Although, patients in BMI class II and class III reported significantly improved pain 3 months after TKA compared to those with normal BMI, all BMI groups attained similar level of pain reduction at 12 months after TKA. The greatest improvement in all WOMAC subscales, as well as EQ5D index, occurred between baseline and 3 months (adjusted p < 0.0001) CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that patients reported improved pain, function, and stiffness across all BMI groups following TKA. Patients with BMI classified as obese reported similar benefits to those with BMI classified as normal weight These results may help health care providers to discuss expectations regarding the TKA recovery in terms of pain, function, and quality of life improvements with their TKA candidates",10.1186/s12891-022-04997-4

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to estimate utility changes associated with the use of tacrolimus ointment in the maintenance treatment of adults with AD. METHODS: Data were collected from a clinical trial investigating long-term maintenance treatment with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment in adults with AD. All patients were treated with twice-daily tacrolimus ointment during an open-label period (OLP) of up to 6 weeks, with subsequent randomization to a double-blind disease-control period (DCP) of 12 months comparing tacrolimus ointment, used twice weekly as maintenance treatment, vs. the emollient vehicle as standard treatment Health-related utility (EQ-5D(index)) was estimated by Monte Carlo simulation from SF-12 responses by application of a published response mapping algorithm and the U.K. tariff for EQ-5D responses and SF-6D responses, respectively. RESULTS: Evaluable data were available for 257 patients stratified into mild, moderate or severe AD with a median age at screening of 28 years [interquartile range (IQR) 22-38] and 40% male. At screening the median EQ-5D(index) across the strata was 0.848 units (IQR 0.704-0.882) for mild cases, 0.796 (0.737-0.876) for moderate cases, and 0.760 (0.661-0.823, P < 0.001) for those with severe disease. At the end of the OLP, mean utility improvement across all strata was 0.027 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.011 to 0.065, P = 0.165] for mild cases, 0.046 (95% CI 0.015-0.064, P = 0.002) for moderate cases and 0.076 (95% CI 0.035-0.118, P < 0.001) for those with severe disease. At the end of the blinded DCP, repeated measures analysis showed an age- and sex-adjusted mean change of 0.045 units (P < 0.001) for subjects treated with tacrolimus ointment over those treated with emollient vehicle. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with AD of all severities showed considerable decrements in health-related utility. However, treatment with 0.1% tacrolimus ointment was associated with clinically significant improvement in health-related utility for patients with moderate and severe AD, which was sustained over a 12-month maintenance period compared with those using standard treatment with an emollient vehicle",10.1111/j.1365-2133.2009.09379.x

Our aim was to determine the frequency and the related features of movement disorders in a cohort of patients with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. METHODS: It is a cross-sectional study of patients with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. Patients were evaluated by a movement disorder specialist. Data from a personal interview and neurological examination were collected. Fahn-Tolosa-Marin tremor rating scale was used for tremor evaluation Health-related quality of life was assessed using EuroQol instrument. RESULTS: Two hundred fifty-three patients were included (mean [SD] age, 40 [12] years; 74.3% female; median [IQR] EDSS score 2.5 [1.0-6.0]); 26% presented with movement disorders. Paroxysmal dystonia (n = 32) and tremor (n = 27) were the most common movement disorders. Patients with multiple sclerosis and low Expanded Disability Status Scale score (below 4.0) have fewer movement disorders than patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder. The diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder was strongly associated with paroxysmal dystonia (OR = 22.07, 95% CI = 2.56-189.78; p = 0.005). Patients with multiple sclerosis and patients without movement disorders have a slightly better quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Paroxysmal dystonia was the most common movement disorder in demyelinating diseases and strongly associated with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder",10.1016/j.parkreldis.2018.03.001

METHOD: This case-control study was performed in patients discharged from a teaching hospital after being admitted to the ICU with severe sepsis Medical records from 349 patients were retrieved from the hospital sepsis registry. Each patient with sepsis was considered as a case. Patients who were admitted immediately after the sepsis episode were considered as controls, provided that they did not have sepsis and survived the ICU admission. This specific study population included 100 patients. RESULTS: The sepsis group showed higher mortality at 1 year compared with critically ill patients. However, the control group showed no sepsis. Older patients (>60 years) in the sepsis group had a significantly higher prevalence of problems. There were no differences in EQ-VAS between respondents from both groups. CONCLUSIONS: After discharge from ICU, sepsis survivors of sepsis had a higher mortality rate than critically ill patients without sepsis. Older patients with sepsis had more moderate and severe problems in all five quality of life dimensions evaluated",10.1590/S0104-11692013000300020

In patients with bilateral replacements the median Euroqol General health score was 50 which was significantly lower than that of 75 in those with a unilateral replacement (p = 0.047). The main complication was progression of disease, which was identified radiologically in 11 knees (22%) This highlights the need for accurate selection of patients. Our findings suggest that the Avon prosthesis survives well and gives a satisfactory functional outcome in the medium term",10.1302/0301-620X.92B1.23135
1451,Is health-related quality of life between 90 and 180 days following stroke associated with long-term unmet needs?,Aged; Female; Humans; Long-Term Care/methods; Male; Middle Aged; Sickness Impact Profile; Stroke/mortality/physiopathology/psychology; Time Factors; EQ-5D; Health-related quality of life; International Classification of Function; Long-term outcomes; Stroke; Unmet needs,"PURPOSE: Understanding the relationship between health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and long-term unmet needs is important for guiding services to optimise life following stroke. We investigated whether HRQoL between 90 and 180 days following stroke was associated with long-term unmet needs. METHODS: Data from Australian Stroke Clinical Registry (AuSCR) registrants who participated in the Australian Stroke Survivor Needs Survey were used. Outcome data, including the EQ-5D, are routinely collected in AuSCR between 90 and 180 days post-stroke Unmet needs were assessed at a median of 2 years and categorised into: health; everyday living; work/leisure; and support domains. Multivariable regression was used to determine associations between the EQ-5D dimensions and the likelihood of experiencing unmet needs and the visual analogue scale (VAS) (rating 0-100) and number of reported unmet needs. RESULTS: In total, 173 AuSCR registrants completed the Needs Survey (median age 69 years, 67 % male; 77 % ischaemic stroke). VAS scores were negatively associated with the number of reported long-term unmet needs [irr 0.98, (95 % CI 0.97, 0 99) p < 0.001]. Having EQ-5D activity limitations was associated with unmet living needs (aOR 4.5, 95 % CI 1.1, 18.8). Requiring living supports at 90-180 days was associated with unmet health needs (aOR 4.9, 95 % CI 1.5, 16.1). Those with pain at 90-180 days were less likely to report unmet health (aOR 0.09, 95 % CI 0.02, 0.4) and support needs (aOR 0.2, 95 % CI 0.06, 0.6). CONCLUSION: Routinely collected HRQoL data can identify survivors at risk of experiencing long-term unmet needs. This information is important for targeting service delivery to optimise outcomes following stroke",10.1007/s11136-016-1234-5

However, no study has simultaneously evaluated the effects of BJT for both anorexia and AD. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, usual care-controlled, assessor-blinded. parallel, pilot clinical trial has been designed to explore the feasibility, preliminary effectiveness, and safety of BJT for the treatment of anorexic patients with AD. Forty anorexic patients with AD will be randomly assigned (1:1) to BJT or the usual care group. The BJT group will be administered BJT granules twice a day for 8 weeks and followed up for 4 weeks whereas the usual care group will not receive BJT granules. All participants in both groups will be provided with over-the-counter topical corticosteroids as a relief drug. Data will be collected at baseline and at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after randomization. The primary outcome is the score on the anorexia visual analog scale at 8 weeks post-treatment. The secondary outcomes include body weight, body fat percentage, body fat mass, skeletal muscle mass, SCORing of Atopic Dermatitis index, Validated Investigator Global Assessment scale for Atopic Dermatitis, Dermatology Life Quality Index, EuroQoL 5 Dimension 5 Level, deficiency and excess pattern identification questionnaire, total immunoglobulin E, eosinophil count, and frequency and amount of use of topical corticosteroids. Adverse events and laboratory test results will be monitored to assess safety. Fecal samples to check for gut microbiome changes and blood samples to check immune and metabolic markers will be collected before and after taking BJT. DISCUSSION: This is the first trial that explores the preliminary effectiveness and safety of BJT for the treatment of anorexic patients with AD The results of this pilot study will provide the basic evidence for large-scale, confirmatory, multicenter, high-quality clinical trials.

The EQ-5D index values were calculated based on the Chinese Time Trade-Off values set. The EQ-5D descriptive system scores, visual analogue scale scores, and index values were described by ethnic group. The EQ-5D index was modeled against ethnic culture, residential segregation and socioeconomic development using villages as random effects. RESULTS: The median (IQR) of HRQoL among all the ethnic groups was 0.88 (0.80, 0.96). Pain/discomfort was the most prevalent problem, followed by anxiety/depression. After controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, a significant difference in HRQoL among ethnic groups persisted, but this was not true for residential segregation. CONCLUSION: Social welfare and health policies designed to improve the health of the rural elderly should focus more on older, female, less-educated, Yao minority individuals as well as lower-income households",10.1186/s12955-016-0499-2

DESIGN: 523 patients admitted to the intensive care department from October 1994 to June 1995 were included consecutively in the study. Health status 3 months prior to admission was assessed retrospectively by proxies using the EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D) and the Karnofsky Performance Status Scale (KF). Patients were classified into four admission categories: trauma injury, scheduled surgery, unscheduled surgery and other medical conditions. SETTING: Department of Intensive Medicine, University Hospital of Bellvitge, Barcelona, Spain. PATIENTS: 84 trauma injury patients, 239 scheduled surgery patients, 57 unscheduled surgery patients and 143 patients with other medical conditions INTERVENTIONS: The descriptive system and visual analogue scale (VAS) of the EQ-5D and the K.F. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Using proxy responses we found that trauma injury patients had the best PHS and scheduled surgery patients the worst. There were statistically significant differences in mean VAS scores and all EQ-5D dimensions, except self-care, when trauma injury patients or scheduled surgery patients were compared with the other admission categories. No significant differences were found on these variables between unscheduled surgery patients and medical patients. We found no statistically significant differences in PHS health status between patients who died and those who survived, either within each admission category or in the sample as a whole. CONCLUSIONS: The PHS of critically ill patients varied according to admission category. Given the instruments used and population studied, there was no association between PHS and hospital outcome",10.1007/s001340050646
3973,Worse pre-admission quality of life is a strong predictor of mortality in critically ill patients,EQ5D5L scores; intensive care unit; preadmission; prognosis; quality of life analysis; short form-12,"OBJECTIVES: In this study, we aimed to investigate whether quality of life (QoL) before intensive care unit (ICU) admission could predict ICU mortality in critically ill patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January 2019 and April 2019, a total of 105 ICU patients (54 males, 51 females; mean age: 58 years; range, 18 to 91 years) from two ICUs of a tertiary care hospital were included in this cross-sectional, prospective study. Pre-admission QoL was measured by the Short Form (SF)-12- Physical Component Scores (PCS) and Mental Component Scores (MCS) and EuroQoL five-dimension, five-level scale (EQ-5D-5L) within 24 h of ICU admission and mortality rates were estimated. RESULTS: The overall mortality rate was 28.5%. Pre-admission QoL was worse in the non-survivors independent from age, sex, socioeconomic and education status, and comorbidities. During the hospitalization, the rate of sepsis and ventilator/hospital-acquired pneumonia were similar among the two groups (p>0.05). Logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, education status, and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores showed that pre-admission functional status as assessed by the SF-12 MCS (odds ratio [OR]: 14,2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5-79.0), SF-12 PCS (OR: 10.6; 95% CI: 1.8-62.7), and EQ-5D-5L (OR: 8.0; 95% CI: 1.5-44.5) were found to be independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Worse pre-admission QoL is a strong predictor of mortality in critically ill patients. The SF-12 and EQ-5D-5L scores are both valuable tools for this assessment. Not only the physical status, but also the mental status before ICU admission should be evaluated in terms of QoL to better utilize ICU resources",10.5606/tftrd.2022.5287

DESIGN: A case-control study was undertaken matching patients with IBS and controls. Quality-of-life information was collected using the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36) health survey, EuroQOL instrument (EQ-5D) and IBS Quality-of-Life (IBS-QOL) instruments. Data on time off work was also collected. National Health Service (NHS) resource use in primary and secondary care was estimated by review of general practitioner (GP) and hospital records over a 12-month period. SETTING: Recruitment was from six GPs' surgeries in the Trent Region of the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: 161 patients with IBS, as defined by the Rome Criteria I were recruited. These were compared with 213 controls matched for age, sex and social characteristics. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: SF-36 and EQ-5D scores; mean number of days off work; mean NHS costs per person during the 12-month study period. RESULTS: Patients with IBS had considerably lower HR-QOL than controls. They scored worse in all dimensions of the SF-36 and the EQ-5D and they had more time off work. On average patients with IBS cost the NHS 123 UK pounds (95% confidence interval: 35 UK pounds to 221 UK pounds, 1999 values) more per year than individuals in the control group (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: IBS affects patients through reduced quality of life, more time off work and greater healthcare utilisation than a control group of patients without IBS. The difference in quality of life was pronounced and unusual in that it was influential in every dimension of both the SF-36 and the EQ-5D",10.2165/00019053-200220070-00003

There is increasing evidence of the effect of risk of malnutrition (ROM) on outcomes in orthopedic surgical patients. However, there is little data on the effect of nutritional status on clinical outcomes in orthopedic trauma patients with surgical site infections (SSI). Therefore, our aim was to investigate how malnutrition risk affects clinical outcomes in a prospective cohort of orthopedic trauma patients with SSI. METHODS: The study included 345 patients who underwent surgery due to SSI at a level 1 trauma center. All patients were evaluated on their nutritional status as assessed by the Nutritional Risk Screening in 2014/15 and 2017/18. 238 (69.0%) datasets were available for the follow-up analysis. Twenty patients (8.4%) had died, resulting in 218 patients. Outcomes investigated included comorbidities, medication intake, destination of discharge, degree of mobility, support for procuring food, mortality risk and quality of life. RESULTS: 32.8% were at risk of malnutrition (ROM) at EXAM1. Female patients had a higher ROM than males (p < 0.05). Patients with ROM had more comorbidities (p < 0.001), an increased need for medication intake (p < 0.001), a decreased level of mobility (p < 0.001) and increased need of support in procuring food (p < 0.001). The destination of discharge was independent of the nutritional status (p = 0.641). Twenty (8.4%) of the available 238 patients had died during follow-up time period, resulting in a 6.2-times higher risk of mortality in patients with ROM. EQ-5D revealed that mobility, self-supply and usual activities of daily living were increased in well-nourished patients (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: ROM in orthopedic trauma patients with SSI is associated with an increased number of comorbidities and need for medication intake, a decrease in mobility and a higher dependency for food acquisition Patients at ROM exhibited a 6.2-times higher mortality rate than well-nourished patients. EQ-5D evaluation showed better mobility, self-supply, and activity of daily living in well-nourished patients. We therefore strongly recommend supplementing patients with ROM with a specific diet during and after discharge from the hospital in order to reduce postoperative complications and long-term mortality",10.1016/j.injury.2020.06.019

The aim of this study was to observe and analyze health related quality of life after a hospital episode for patients with community acquired pneumococcal pneumonia in France. METHODS: A total of 524 individuals were enrolled prospectively in the study and were followed for 12 months after hospital discharge. Presence of streptococcus pneumoniae was confirmed by microbiological sampling. Quality of life was reported at four different points of time with the EQ-5D-3 L health states using the French reference tariff. Complete data on all four periods was available for 269 patients. We used descriptive and econometric analysis to assess quality of life over time during follow-up, and to identify factors that impact the utility indexes and their evolution through time. We used Tobit panel data estimators to deal with the bounded nature of utility values. RESULTS: Average age of patients was 63 and 55% of patients were men. Negative predictors of quality of life were the severity of the initial event, history of pneumonia, smokers, age and being male. On average, quality of life improved in the first 6 months after discharge and stabilized beyond. At month 1, mean utility index was 0.53 (SD: 0.34) for men and 0.45 (SD: 0.34) for women, versus mean of 0.69 (SD: 0.33) and 0.70 (SD: 0.35) at Month 12. ""Usual activities"" was the dimension the most impacted by the disease episode. Utilities for men were significantly higher than for women, although male patients were more severe. Individuals over 85 years old did not improve quality of life during follow-up, and quality of life did not improve or deteriorated for 34% of patients. We found that length of hospital stay was negatively correlated with quality of life immediately after discharge. CONCLUSION: This study provides with evidence that quality of life after an episode of community acquired pneumococcal pneumonia improves overall until the sixth month after hospital discharge, but older patients with previous history of pneumonia may not experience health gains after the initial episode",10.1186/s12955-018-0854-6

The concept of minimum clinically important difference (MCID) is considered the new standard for determining the effectiveness of a given treatment and describing patient satisfaction in response to that treatment. The purpose of this study was to determine the MCID associated with surgical treatment for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. METHODS The authors queried the Quality Outcomes Database registry from July 2014 through December 2015 for patients who underwent posterior lumbar surgery for grade I degenerative spondylolisthesis. Recorded PROs included scores on the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), EQ-5D, and numeric rating scale (NRS) for leg pain (NRS-LP) and back pain (NRS-BP). Anchor-based (using the North American Spine Society satisfaction scale) and distribution-based (half a standard deviation, small Cohen's effect size, standard error of measurement, and minimum detectable change [MDC]) methods were used to calculate the MCID for each PRO. RESULTS A total of 441 patients (80 who underwent laminectomies alone and 361 who underwent fusion procedures) from 11 participating sites were included in the analysis. The changes in functional outcome scores between baseline and the 1-year postoperative evaluation were as follows: 23.5 ± 17.4 points for ODI, 0.24 ± 0.23 for EQ-5D, 4.1 ± 3.5 for NRS-LP, and 3.7 ± 3.2 for NRS-BP. The different calculation methods generated a range of MCID values for each PRO: 3.3-26.5 points for ODI, 0.04-0.3 points for EQ-5D, 0.6-4.5 points for NRS-LP, and 0.5-4.2 points for NRS-BP. The MDC approach appeared to be the most appropriate for calculating MCID because it provided a threshold greater than the measurement error and was closest to the average change difference between the satisfied and not-satisfied patients. On subgroup analysis, the MCID thresholds for laminectomy-alone patients were comparable to those for the patients who underwent arthrodesis as well as for the entire cohort. CONCLUSIONS The MCID for PROs was highly variable depending on the calculation technique. The MDC seems to be a statistically and clinically sound method for defining the appropriate MCID value for patients with grade I degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis. Based on this method, the MCID values are 14.3 points for ODI, 0.2 points for EQ-5D, 1.7 points for NRS-LP, and 1.6 points for NRS-BP",10.3171/2017.10.FOCUS17554

The aim of this study was to determine whether greater positive personality trait scores modify the association between income and oral and general health-related quality of life (OHRQoL and HRQoL) among a representative sample of the South Australian population. Cross-sectional self-rated questionnaire data from a sample of 3645 adults in 2015-2016 were used for secondary analysis. In four factorial ANOVA models, the main effects, interaction, and effect modification of personality traits [measured using the Ten-Item Personality Inventory (TIPI)] on the association between income and OHRQoL [measured using the Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14)] and HRQoL [measured using the European Quality of Life indicator (EQ-5D-3L)] were assessed. In the low-income group, participants with greater TIPI scale scores had lower means for the OHIP-14 and the EQ-5D-3L (better OHRQoL and HRQoL). Greater emotional stability scores modified the association between low income and HRQoL and OHRQoL. Stronger positive personality traits, such as emotional stability, appear to ameliorate the adverse effect of income inequalities in health",10.1111/eos.12893

METHODS: In total, 8,578 people with T2DM starting treatment with, or switching to, BIAsp 30 were recruited from 130 urban hospitals in China. HRQoL was assessed at baseline and 24 weeks using the EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, paired t-test, and chi-square test were conducted and the linear ordinary least squares regression model was used to determine predictors for changes in EQ-5D score. RESULTS: Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) decreased from 9.5% to 7.0% after 24 weeks. The reported HRQoL measured by the EQ-5D visual analogue scale score increased by 6.2 (p < 0.001) from 75.8 to 82.0, and EQ-5D index score increased by 0.018 (p < 0.001) from 0.875 to 0.893 for the cohort over 24 weeks. The percentage of patients reporting no problems in the mobility, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression dimensions of EQ-5D increased significantly (p < 0.001) from 88.4% to 91.4%, 77.3% to 82.8%, and 74.2% to 77.1%, respectively. Patients with higher HbA1c levels at baseline, major hypoglycaemia or micro-complications exhibited significantly larger changes in EQ-5D scores than those with lower baseline HbA1c levels, without major hypoglycaemia or micro-complications after controlling for demographics and other baseline characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: BIAsp 30 treatment was associated with improved glycaemic control and HRQoL in T2DM patients in China.

Furthermore, little is known about the underlying mechanisms which lead to a diminished quality of life (QoL). The primary objective of this study is to explore to what extent QoL is impaired in adults who stutter (AWS). In addition, this study aims to identify determinants of QoL in AWS by testing relationships between stuttering severity, coping, functioning and QoL and by testing for differences in variable scores between two AWS subgroups: receiving therapy versus not receiving therapy. A total of 91 AWS filled in several questionnaires to assess their stuttering severity, daily functioning, coping style and QoL. The QoL instruments used were the Health Utility Index 3 (HUI3) and the EuroQoL EQ-5D and EQ-VAS. The results indicated that moderate to severe stuttering has a negative impact on overall quality of life; HUI3 derived QoL values varied from .91 (for mild stuttering) to .73 (for severe stuttering). The domains of functioning that were predominantly affected were the individual's speech, emotion, cognition and pain as measured by the HUI3 and daily activities and anxiety/depression as measured by the EQ-5D. AWS in the therapy group rated their stuttering as more severe and recorded more problems on the HUI3 speech domain than AWS in the non-therapy group. The EQ-VAS was the only instrument that showed a significant difference in overall QoL between groups Finally, it was found that the relationship between stuttering severity and QoL was influenced by the individual's coping style (emotion-oriented and task-oriented). These findings highlight the need for further research into stuttering in relation to QoL, and for a broader perspective on the diagnosis and treatment of stuttering, which would take into consideration quality of life and its determinants",10.1016/j.jcomdis.2011.02.002

However, female CCS are at risk of developing premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) after cancer treatment. POI involves a decreased chance of conceiving and the increased infertility state has a large impact on affected individuals' health and mental life. The objective of this study was to investigate health state and well-being among female CCS with and without POI and healthy controls (HC). METHODS: Female CCS treated in southern Sweden between 1964 and 2008 were included. Each patient was matched with a HC The final study population included 167 female CCS and 164 HC that were examined between October 2010 and January 2015 at the Reproductive Medicine Centre at Skåne University Hospital in Malmö, Sweden. All participants, except for two HCs, answered an EQ-5D-3L questionnaire for measuring health state including a visual analogue scale (VAS) for estimating well-being. RESULTS: There were 22 CCS with POI, none of the HC had POI. The mean health state differed among groups (unadjusted: P = 0.002; adjusted: P = 0.007). A difference in mean experienced well-being among groups was noted (unadjusted: P = 0.003; adjusted: P = 0.012) Lowest well-being was found in the CCS group with POI (P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: Female CCS have a significantly decreased health state and well-being. Female CCS with POI additionally have the lowest self-estimated well-being. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: Female CCS with POI should be identified early in order to give them adequate information and support",10.1007/s11764-021-00987-y

A one year increase in disease duration and 0.1 decrease of the EQ-5D utility score increase the yearly costs by 8 to 10%, and 7.8%, respectively. The effect of the PDQ-39 score on total cost was not significant CONCLUSIONS: Disease severity and public health importance of PD are clearly demonstrated by the magnitude of QoL loss. PD-related costs are substantial, but are much lower in Hungary than in Western European countries. Disease duration and EQ-5D score are significant proxy of costs",10.1371/journal.pone.0107704

To investigate the HRQoL and their determinants among HF patients with and without comorbidities. METHODS AND RESULTS: TRIUMPH (TRanslational Initiative on Unique and novel strategies for Management of Patients with Heart failure) is a Dutch prospective, multicentre study enrolling 496 acute HF patients between 2009 and 2014. We included 334 patients who had completed the HRQoL questionnaires at baseline. The HRQoL was measured by the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) en EuroQuality-of-life five Dimensions (EQ-5D). Comorbidity was defined as having a history of at least one of the following comorbidities: chronic kidney disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and/or cerebrovascular accident. Patients with comorbidity (n = 205, 61%) had lower scores on the physical limitation scale and clinical summary score of the KCCQ (P = 0.03 and P = 0.01, respectively) Female sex, COPD, previous HF, increasing body mass index (BMI), elevated N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), high systolic blood pressure, and the presence of anxiety and/or depression negatively influenced the HRQoL among HF patients with comorbidity. Besides anxiety and depression, we hardly found any other determinant of HRQoL in patients without comorbidity CONCLUSION: Heart failure patients without comorbidity had better HRQoL than patients with comorbidity. Sex, previous HF, BMI, COPD, systolic blood pressure, NT-proBNP levels, and also anxiety and depression were determinants of HRQoL in patients with comorbidity. In those without comorbidity, apart from anxiety and depression, no further determinants of HRQoL were found",10.1093/eurjcn/zvab061
8679,Patient reported outcomes measures (PROMs) trajectories after elective hip arthroplasty: a latent class and growth mixture analysis,Arthroplasty; Hip; Implant registry; PROMs; Patient-reported outcome measures; Quality improvement,"BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are an extensively used tool to assess and improve the quality of healthcare services. PROMs can be related to individual demographic and clinical characteristics in patients undergoing hip arthroplasty (HA). The aim of this study is to identify distinct subgroups of patients with unique trajectories of PROMS scores and to determine patients' features associated with these subgroups. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, cohort study in which PROMs questionnaires (Euro Quality 5 Dimensions 3L, EQ-5D-3L, Euro-Quality-Visual-Analytic-Score, EQ-VAS, Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, HOOS-PS) were administered to patients undergoing elective HA pre-operatively, and at 6 and 12 months after surgery. For each measure, latent class growth analysis and growth mixture models were used to identify subgroups of patients with distinct trajectories of scores Demografic and clinical predictors of the latent classes in growth mixture model were identified using a 3-step approach. RESULTS: We found three distinct trajectories for each PROM score. These trajectories indicated a response heterogeneity to the HA among the patients (n = 991). Patient's gender, ASA score, and obesity were significantly associated with different PROMs trajectories. CONCLUSIONS: We identified three distinct trajectories for each of the three PROMs indicators. Several demographic and clinical characteristics are associated with the different trajectories of PROMs at 6 and 12 months after HA and could be used to identify groups of patients with different outcomes following HA surgery. These findings underline the importance of patient-centered care, supporting the usefulness of integrating PROMs data alongside routinely collected healthcare records for guiding clinical care and maximizing patients' positive outcomes.

This paper is an exploratory attempt to find suitable methods to assess caregivers' HRQoL, using a population of parents of children with major congenital anomalies. METHODS: A total of 306 parents of children born with either congenital anorectal malformations (ARM) or congenital diaphragmatic hernia were surveyed. They rated their current HRQoL on the EQ-VAS After that, they rated their HRQoL again on the assumption that someone would take over their caregiving activities completely and free of charge. Finally, the parents classified their HRQoL on the EQ-5D. The caregivers' scores on the EQ-VAS and the EQ-5D were compared with scores elicited in the general population RESULTS: Most parents indicated that their HRQoL would not change if someone else took on their caregiving activities. Some methodological issues may have influenced this outcome, such as difficulties in self-assessing HRQoL changes due to caregiving, process utility, protest answers, and difficulties in understanding the hypothetical question. The HRQoL of the parents was relatively low compared with population statistics, especially in the parents of children with ARM and in mothers. This can be illustrated by the difference between the mean EQ-5D score of the mothers aged 25-34 years of the children with ARM and that of the general population (0.83 vs. 0.93; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Significant HRQoL differences exist between parents caring for children with congenital anomalies and the general population. It would be useful to further improve our understanding of the HRQoL impact of informal caregiving, separating 'caregiving effects' from 'family effects', and distinguishing parent-child relationships from other caregiving situations. This study underlines the importance of considering caregivers, also in the context of economic evaluations. It indicates that general HRQoL measures, as used in patients, may be able to detect HRQoL effects in caregivers, which facilitates the incorporation in common economic evaluations of HRQoL effects in carers. Analysts and policy makers should be aware that if HRQoL improvement is an important aim, they should register HRQoL changes not only in patients but also in their caregivers",10.1007/s11136-011-9991-7

The aim of this study is to describe long-term health-related quality of life (HRQoL), functional independence and psychological distress 3 and 12 months post-IHCA. METHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort study in 25 hospitals between January 2017 - May 2018. Adult IHCA survivors were included. HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L, SF-12), psychological distress (HADS, CSI) and functional independence (mRS) were assessed at 3 and 12 months post-IHCA. RESULTS: At 3-month follow-up 136 of 212 survivors responded to the questionnaire and at 12 months 110 of 198 responded. The median (IQR) EQ-utility Index score was 0.77 (0.65-0.87) at 3 months and 0.81 (0.70-0.91) at 12 months At 3 months, patients reported a median SF-12 (IQR) physical component scale (PCS) of 38.9 (32.8-46.5) and mental component scale (MCS) of 43.5 (34.0-39.7) and at 12 months a PCS of 43.1 (34.6-52.3) and MCS 46.9 (38.5-54.5). DISCUSSION: Using various tools most IHCA survivors report an acceptable HRQoL and a substantial part experiences lower HRQoL compared to population norms. Our data suggest that younger (male) patients and those with poor functional status prior to admission are at highest risk of impaired HRQoL",10.1016/j.jcrc.2021.11.008

The ongoing Conservative vs Liberal Approach to fluid therapy of Septic Shock in Intensive Care (CLASSIC) trial assesses the benefits and harms of a restrictive vs standard-care intravenous (IV) fluid therapy. The hypothesis is that IV fluid restriction improves patient-important long-term outcomes. AIM: To assess the predefined patient-important long-term outcomes in patients randomised into the CLASSIC trial. METHODS: In this pre-planned follow-up study of the CLASSIC trial, we will assess all-cause mortality, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and cognitive function 1 year after randomisation in the two intervention groups. The 1-year mortality will be collected from electronic patient records or central national registries in most participating countries. We will contact survivors and assess EuroQol 5-Dimension, -5-Level (EQ-5D-5L) and EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale and Montreal Cognitive Assessment 5-minute protocol score. We will analyse mortality by logistic regression and use general linear models to assess HRQoL and cognitive function. DISCUSSION: With this pre-planned follow-up study of the CLASSIC trial, we will provide patient-important data on long-term survival, HRQoL and cognitive function of restrictive vs standard-care IV fluid therapy in patients with septic shock",10.1111/aas.13519

There are reports of successful management of lumbar pathology in the absence of global sagittal or coronal imbalance, with limited decompression and fusion, addressing only the symptomatic segment. PURPOSE: Our study examined the long-term outcomes of transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF), a less extensive procedure, based on the experience of the senior author over the past 10 years. STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: This was a retrospective study of symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis and spinal deformity managed by one surgeon at The Cleveland Clinic since 2003. PATIENT SAMPLE: Forty-one patients were included in the study. OUTCOME MEASURES: The present study measures the long-term clinical functional outcomes of these patients through EQ-5D (EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire), PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire), and PDQ (Pain Disability Questionnaire) forms, along with documented radiographic parameters and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). METHODS: There were no funding or potential conflicts of interest associated biases in the present study. Patients with symptomatic lumbar spinal stenosis with neutral global alignment in the sagittal and coronal planes and symptomatic stenosis at the deformity level were treated by limited fusion and TLIF, and had a follow-up period of at least 5 years. Excluded were patients under 18 years of age, had more than three levels of fusion, and had an active spinal malignancy or recent spinal trauma. The grouping variables were curve magnitude, revision surgeries, and TLIF levels. Clinical outcomes were compared in all the grouping variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were utilized; p<.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: The average age and follow-up period were 66±10 and 7.5 years, respectively. There was no statistical difference between patients with curves measuring between 10° and 20° and greater than 20° for EQ-5D, PHQ-9, and PDQ. Patients had worse PDQ data with larger curves compared with smaller curves at both 5 years and final follow-up. Although there was no statistical significance between preoperative coronal curve magnitude and revision surgeries, patients with curves greater than 20° had higher rates of revision surgeries (75%; p=.343) in the global lumbar curve deformity group. Although there was no statistical significance for patients who underwent revision surgeries,those patients had low PHQ-9 values at the final follow-up (p=.09). The revision surgery rate was 48% in one-level TLIF and 18% in two-level TLIF. Moderate pain disability scores were noticed for one-level TLIF patients (mean=75) compared with two-level TLIF patients (mean=27) at the final follow-up, and approached statistical significance in this comparison (p=.06). CONCLUSION: Although this topic has a limited audience to spinal deformity surgeons, the prevalence of patients who present with adult spinal deformities has been increasing. Short segment fusion, in the setting of modest spinal deformity, is a reasonable and safe option. Further study on the concept of short segment fusions in the growing patient population is required as more comprehensive fusions do have noted complication rates, and a compromise must be reached between the extent of surgery that is enough to provide pain relief and disability and the degree of surgery that is too much to be tolerated in terms of complication rates",10.1016/j.spinee.2017.10.063

A trauma database was searched to identify all skeletally-mature patients with an undisplaced or minimally-displaced scaphoid waist fracture managed with early percutaneous retrograde screw fixation over a thirteen-year period from 1997-2010. Medical records were retrospectively reviewed, and complications documented. Long-term follow-up was by a questionnaire-based review. The Patient-Rated Wrist Evaluation (PRWE) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included the Quick version of the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand score (QuickDASH), the EuroQol 5-dimensions score (EQ-5D-5L), and complications. During the study period 114 patients underwent this procedure. The mean age was 28 years (range 17-62) and 97 patients (85%) were male. The median time from injury to surgery was nine days (range 1-27) Twelve patients (11%) reported a complication, all of whom required repeat surgical intervention (six revision ORIF for non-union, five elective removal of hardware, one early revision fixation due to screw impingement). Long-term outcome data was available for 77 patients (68%) at mean follow-up of 11.4 years (range 6.4-19.8). The median PRWE was 0 (IQR 0-7.5), median QuickDASH 0 (IQR 0-4.5) and median EQ-5D-5L 1.0 (IQR 0.837-1.0). There were 97% (n = 74) patients satisfied with their outcome. Early percutaneous fixation of acute non-displaced or minimally displaced scaphoid fractures results in good long-term patient reported outcomes and health-related quality of life. Although comparable with previous studies, the overall surgical reintervention rate is notable and can result in inferior outcomes.

Data on health-related quality of life (HrQoL) in patients with poststroke epilepsy are limited. We investigated HrQoL in patients with epilepsy after ischemic stroke and identified independent HrQoL-determinants. METHODS AND PATIENTS: All patients with acute ischemic stroke, who were permanent residents in the district Marburg-Biedenkopf (Hessia, Germany, reference population 240,000 inhabitants) were recruited within 12months in the population-based Marburg Stroke Register (MARSTREG). Follow-up visits were performed after 6, 12, and 24months, and patients who developed poststroke epilepsy were identified. Data on demographics, antiepileptic drugs (AEDs), stroke severity (National Institute of Heath Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel-Index, modified Rankin Scale), depression (Geriatric Depression Scale), and HrQoL (EQ-5D and EQ VAS) were collected. A multiple regression analysis was performed to identify HrQoL-determinants. RESULTS: Among the study participants (n=374), 23 (6.1%) developed poststroke epilepsy. The HrQoL of patients with poststroke epilepsy was reduced in comparison with patients without seizures (24-month follow-up: EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale (EuroQol-VAS): 55.3±10.7 versus 64.2±11.4, p=0.03). Seizure frequency, depression, and functional impairment (Barthel-Index) were identified as independent determinants of HrQoL. The adjustment of AEDs between 6-month and 24-month follow-ups resulted in decrease of seizure frequency by 40% and reduction of complications (dizziness by 27.8%, nausea by 52.2%, fatigue by 84.2%). CONCLUSION: Lesional epilepsy is associated with decreased HrQoL in patients with stroke. We identified HrQoL-determinants, which would improve the management of patients with poststroke epilepsy. These determinants include proper adjustment of AEDs with reduction of seizure frequency, treatment of depression, and focused rehabilitation programs for poststroke epilepsy",10.1016/j.yebeh.2017.12.037

METHODS: The algorithm was developed using data from 345 TDT patients. Spearman's rank correlation was used to evaluate the conceptual overlap between the instruments. Model specifications were chosen using a stepwise regression. Both direct and response mapping methods were attempted. Six mapping estimation methods ordinary least squares (OLS), a log-transformed response using OLS, generalized linear model (GLM), two-part model (TPM), Tobit and multinomial logistic regression (MLOGIT) were tested to determine the root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE). Other criterion used were accuracy of the predicted utility score, proportions of absolute differences that was less than 0.03 and intraclass correlation coefficient. An in-sample, leave-one-out cross validation was conducted to test the generalizability of each model. RESULTS: The best performing model was specified with three out of the four PedsQL GCS scales-the physical, emotional and social functioning score. The best performing estimation method for direct mapping was a GLM with a RMSE of 0.1273 and MAE of 0.1016, while the best estimation method for response mapping was the MLOGIT with a RMSE of 0.1597 and MAE of 0.0826. CONCLUSION: The mapping algorithm developed using the GLM would facilitate the calculation of utility scores to inform economic evaluations for TDT patients when EQ-5D data is not available. However, caution should be exercised when using this algorithm in patients who have poor quality of life",10.1007/s10198-021-01287-z
10066,Hispanic valuation of the EQ-5D health states: a social value set for Latin Americans,Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Surveys; Hispanic or Latino; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; United States; Young Adult,"OBJECTIVES: Cost-effectiveness analysis has been recommended by national health agencies worldwide. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence supports the use of generic health-related quality of life instruments such as EuroQol EQ-5D when quality-adjusted life-years are used to measure health benefits. Despite the urgent need for appropriate methodologies to improve the use of scarce resources in Latin American countries, little is known about how health is valued. METHODS: A national population survey was conducted in the United States in 2002, based on a sample of 1603 non-Hispanic nonblacks and 1115 Hispanics. Participants provided time trade-off utilities for a subset of 42 EQ-5D health states. Hispanic respondents were grouped according to their language preferences (Spanish or English). Mean utilities were compared for each health state. A random-effects model was used to determine whether real population differences exist after adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. A population value set for all 243 EQ-5D health states was developed using only the data from Spanish-speaking Hispanics. RESULTS: Mean valuations differed slightly between non-Hispanic nonblacks and English-speaking Hispanics. Spanish-speaking Hispanics, however, tended to give higher valuations than non-Hispanic nonblacks (P < 0.05) corresponding to an average of 0.034 point. A regression model was developed for Spanish-speaking Hispanics with a mean absolute error of 0.031. Values estimated using this model show marked differences when compared with corresponding values estimated using the UK (N3) and US (D1) models. CONCLUSION: The availability of a Hispanic model for EQ-5D valuations represents a significant new option for decision-makers, providing a set of social preference weights for use in Latin American countries that presently lack their own domestic value set",10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00349.x

The relationship between the comorbidity of psychiatric symptoms and quality of life (QoL) in ICU survivors has not been carefully examined. This study examined the relationship between psychiatric comorbidities and QoL in 58 survivors of ICU delirium. Patients completed 3 psychiatric screens at 3 months after discharge from the hospital, including the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire for anxiety, and the Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSS- 10) questionnaire for posttraumatic stress disorder. Patients with 3 positive screens (PHQ-9 = 10; GAD-7 = 10; and PTSS-10 > 35) comprised the high psychiatric comorbidity group. Patients with 1 to 2 positive screens were labeled the low to moderate (low-moderate) psychiatric comorbidity group. Patients with 3 negative screens were labeled the no psychiatric morbidity group. Thirty-one percent of patients met the criteria for high psychiatric comorbidity. After adjusting for age, gender, Charlson Comorbidity Index, discharge status, and prior history of depression and anxiety, patients who had high psychiatric comorbidity were more likely to have a poorer QoL compared with the low-moderate comorbidity and no morbidity groups, as measured by a lower EuroQol 5 dimensions questionnaire 3-level Index (no, 0.69 ± 0.25; low-moderate, 0.70 ± 0.19; high, 0.48 ± 0.24; P = 0.017). Future studies should confirm these findings and examine whether survivors of ICU delirium with high psychiatric comorbidity have different treatment needs from survivors with lower psychiatric comorbidity",10.12788/jhm.2827

METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study investigating IHD patients in China using the Chinese HeartQoL and EQ-5D. Data based on the total group were fitted by 2 linear regression models with the utility score derived from the EQ-5D as a dependent variable and the HeartQoL total and subscale (physical and emotional) scores as independent variables, respectively. The 2 models were compared via modeling fitting statistics. RESULTS: In total, 406 IHD patients were enrolled in China The mean HeartQoL global score for the total group was 1.75 (standard deviation [SD] = 0.85), whereas the mean physical and emotional scores were 1.65 (SD = 0.91) and 1.99 (SD = 0.93), respectively. The mean utility calculated by the EQ-5D for IHD patients was 0.66 (SD = 0.38), as compared with 0.95 (SD = 0.06) for healthy people. From the linear regression model with total score, the total score was a significant predictor for the EQ-5D utility, with the equation as EQ-5D = 0.085 - 0.3294 × total. In the linear regression model with physical and mental scores, both scores were significant predictors for the EQ-5D utility, with an equation as EQ-5D = 0.0671- 0.2091 × physical - 0.1248 × mental. The fitting statistics suggest that the model using the HeartQoL total score is preferred. CONCLUSION: As the first effort to map the HeartQoL to EQ-5D, the linear relationship between these 2 instruments was explored, and this could potentially be useful in future health technology assessment decision making and clinical practice",10.1016/j.vhri.2020.02.001

The objective of this study is to measure the health of a representative sample by conducting a population survey in Burgas by using the EuroQoL EQ-5D-3L questionnaire, and further to assess the influence of socio-economic, demographic and behavioural factors on HrQoL. The relationship between HrQoL and social capital is analysed through a network-based approach. The achieved ambition was to build the public health capacity of the key stakeholders in order to support decision making. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 using a representative sample of the citizens of Burgas (n = 1050, >18 years old) Respondents were selected through the method of two-stage random selection. HrQoL was assessed by the standardized EQ-5D-3L questionnaire. People without any problem in all five dimensions represent only 26.5% (n = 278) of the respondents, whereas 52.2% (n = 548) reported a moderate problem in at least one dimension; any extreme problem reported 11.6% (n = 122) of the respondents. The mean state of health recorded on the Visual Analogue Scale was 70 (SD ±23). There were differences in self-reported health based on the respondent's age, occupation, education, income, smoking behaviour and membership in community groups. People who have hobby and practice sports assessed their health status higher. The results were communicated in a following Delphi-study; a consensus has been reached that the combination of routine measures of health with measurement of self-rated health could provide better understandings of the community health needs",10.1093/heapro/dav016
8379,A cost-effectiveness analysis of first-line induction and maintenance treatment sequences in patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer in France,France; advanced nonsquamous NSCLC; cost-effectiveness; induction–maintenance; pemetrexed; quality-adjusted life-years,"BACKGROUND: Comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness data for induction-maintenance (I-M) sequences for the treatment of patients with nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (nsqNSCLC) are limited because of a lack of direct evidence. This analysis aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of I-M pemetrexed with those of other I-M regimens used for the treatment of patients with advanced nsqNSCLC in the French health-care setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A previously developed global partitioned survival model was adapted to the France-only setting by restricting treatment sequences to include 12 I-M regimens most relevant to France, and incorporating French costs and resource-use data Following a systematic literature review, network meta-analyses were performed to obtain hazard ratios for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) relative to gemcitabine + cisplatin (induction sequences) or best supportive care (BSC) (maintenance sequences). Modeled health-care benefits were expressed as life-years (LYs) and quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs) (estimated using French EuroQol five-dimension questionnaire tariffs). The study was conducted from the payer perspective (National Health Insurance). Cost- and benefit-model inputs were discounted at an annual rate of 4%. RESULTS: Base-case results showed pemetrexed + cisplatin induction followed by (→) pemetrexed maintenance had the longest mean OS and PFS and highest LYs and QALYs. Costs ranged from €12,762 for paclitaxel + carboplatin → BSC to €35,617 for pemetrexed + cisplatin → pemetrexed (2015 values). Gemcitabine + cisplatin → BSC, pemetrexed + cisplatin → BSC, and pemetrexed + cisplatin → pemetrexed were associated with fully incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of €16,593, €80,656, and €102,179, respectively, per QALY gained versus paclitaxel + carboplatin → BSC. All other treatment sequences were either dominated (ie, another sequence had lower costs and better/equivalent outcomes) or extendedly dominated (ie, the comparator had a higher ICER than a more effective comparator) in the model. Sensitivity analyses showed the model to be relatively insensitive to plausible changes in the main assumptions, with none increasing or decreasing the ICER by more than ~€20,000 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: In the absence of direct comparative trial evidence, this cost-effectiveness analysis indicated that of a large number of I-M sequences used for the treatment of patients with nsqNSCLC in France, pemetrexed + cisplatin → pemetrexed achieved the best clinical outcomes (0.28 incremental QALYs gained) versus paclitaxel + carboplatin → BSC",10.2147/CEOR.S128371
1616,Quality of life after Girdlestone resection arthroplasty,Artroplastia cadera infectada; Calidad de vida; Girdlestone; Infected hip arthroplasty; Outcomes; Quality of life; Resultados,"MAIN AIM: To know the result of the Girdlestone resection arthroplasty in the treatment of the infected hip arthroplasty. SECONDARY AIMS: To analyze the effectiveness in the control of pain and infection, the functional outcome and to contrast factors correlated with the final result. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Case series with a total of 17 patients. The control of the infection was assessed according to the presence or absence of sinus, and the clinical status using EuroQol 5D scale, residual pain and limb length discrepancy. OUTCOMES: The most common infecting germ at the time of removal of the arthroplasty was Staphylococcus CN and one patient presented infection by Candida albicans. In 2 patients the draining sinus persisted. The residual dysmetria was 5.24cm. In the EQ-5D scale, the most affected dimensions were mobility, need for help for self-care and ability to carry out activities of daily life. 8 patients maintained, pain levels worse than 4 in the VAS. The variables of dysmetria were correlated inversely with health index (-0,54) and self-perceived general health status (-0,45). CONCLUSIONS: The Girdlestone resection arthroplasty is an alternative in the treatment of the infected hip arthroplasty. Patient perception is inversely corelated to residual dysmetria. The dysmetria is greater in women and in ages over 65 years",10.1016/j.recot.2020.07.001

Clinical outcomes were assessed over 3 years and included surgical reinterventions, Symptom Severity Score (SSS), and Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) subscales of the Uterine Fibroid Symptom and Quality-of-Life Questionnaire, EuroQol 5-Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire, Overall Treatment Effect, treatment satisfaction, physical activity, work impairment, pregnancy outcomes, and adverse events. Results: The 3-year rates of surgical reintervention for heavy menstrual bleeding calculated by the binomial and Kaplan-Meier methods were 9.2% and 8.2%, respectively Compared to baseline, mean SSS decreased from 55 ± 19 to 22 ± 21, HRQoL increased from 40 ± 21 to 83 ± 23, and EQ-5D increased from 0.72 ± 0.21 to 0.88 ± 0.16 (all p < 0.001). Treatment benefit on the SSS, HRQoL, and EQ-5Q exceeded the minimal clinically important difference at every follow-up visit over 3 years. At 3 years, 94% of the subjects reported treatment satisfaction, 88% reported reduced fibroid symptoms, work absenteeism due to fibroid symptoms decreased from 2.9% to 1.4%, and impairment due to fibroids decreased from 51% to 12% for work, and 58% to 14% for physical activity (all p < 0.001). No late complications occurred Conclusions: Women treated with sonography-guided TFA in the SONATA pivotal trial experienced significant and durable reduction of fibroid-related symptoms, with low surgical reintervention rates over 3 years of follow-up",10.1089/gyn.2020.0021

Despite the fact that a significant amount of patients with non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP) might have a history of Cardiac Disease (CD), there is today a lack of knowledge on how CD influences the association between psychological wellbeing and HRQoL in patients with NCCP. Therefore, the aim of this study is to describe HRQoL in patients with NCCP, with or without history of CD, and to explore the association between HRQoL and cardiac anxiety, depressive symptoms, fear of body sensations and somatization. METHODS: Five hundred fifty-two patients discharged with NCCP from four hospitals in Southeast Sweden completed the EQ-5D, Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, Body Sensations Questionnaire, and Patient Health Questionnaire-15. RESULTS: Fifty precent reported at least moderate problems regarding pain/discomfort and 25% reported at least moderate problems in the HRQoL dimensions mobility, usual activities, and anxiety/depression. Patients with NCCP and history of CD reported significantly lower HRQoL (p ≤ 0.05) compared to patients with NCCP without CD. In the total study population, cardiac anxiety, depressive symptoms, and somatization had weak significant negative associations (beta = 0.187-0.284, p < 0.001) with HRQoL. In patients with history of CD, the association between depressive symptoms and HRQoL was moderate (beta = - 0.339, p < 0.001), compared to weak association in patients without CD (beta = - 0.193, p < 0.001). On the other hand, the association between cardiac anxiety and HRQoL was weak in both patients with history of CD (beta = - 0.156, p = 0.05), and in those without (beta = - 0.229, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with NCCP, in particular those with history of CD, reported low levels of HRQoL, which was associated with psychological distress. This should be considered when developing psychological interventions aiming to improve HRQoL in patients with NCCP",10.1186/s12955-020-01297-0

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this Phase 4 trial is to assess the effectiveness of rimonabant plus lifestyle counselling when used in daily practice, namely in the general practice. The hypothesis was that the effectiveness in Phase 4 would be smaller than the efficacy in Phase 3 due to different patient selection and treatment conditions At the end of this trial, rimonabant was suspended of all markets due to psychiatric side effects. METHODS: This trial randomly assigned 222 patients with enlarged waist circumferences and hyperglycaemia or diabetes mellitus type 2, recruited from Dutch general practices, to double-blinded therapy with either placebo or rimonabant (20 mg/day) for 1 year in addition to lifestyle counselling. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, the rimonabant group showed significant improvements in body weight, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and the main outcome waist circumference after 1 year. The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study risk calculation showed no significant difference. The rimonabant group showed statistically deterioration, compared with the placebo group, in the quality of life in the EuroQol and two domains of the SF-36: role limitations due to physical health problems and bodily pain. CONCLUSIONS: The unique real life data of this Phase 4 trial showed that the effectiveness of rimonabant in daily practice is indeed lower than in controlled circumstances (Phase 3). Rimonabant treatment showed improvement of obesity and the HDL cholesterol, but had no positive effect on the other cardiovascular risk factors and the quality of life",10.1093/fampra/cms013

RESULTS: The study included 345 caregivers. Most were males, aged between 25 and 34 years old whose caring responsibilities took between 15 and 24 h per week. The caregivers' mean EQ-5D-5L score was 0.6, with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of [0.58, 0.63], whilst the mean CarerQol-7D score was 72.61 [70.46, 74.76] Caregivers' mental health was the most substantially affected aspect of their QoL. In addition, most caregivers reported deriving some or a lot of fulfilment out of their caregiving tasks. The WPAI:SHP showed that the mean percentage of work impairment due to caregiving responsibilities was 63%, [59.75, 66.26]. The mean annualised costs of productivity losses per caregiver were estimated at €14,872 [€11,908; €17,888]. LIMITATIONS: One limitation consisted in the use of an online survey instead of a face-to-face interview. However, the medical terms were clearly explained, and examples were provided to help participants to give accurate responses. Another limitation was that the respondents self-reported as caregivers. Efforts were made to mitigate this weakness by using screener questions. CONCLUSION: This study found that providing informal care for people with uncontrolled drug-resistant FOS had a negative impact on caregivers' QoL, with mental health being affected the most. However, caregivers found their role fulfilling and had support with their caring tasks",10.1080/13696998.2021.2018871

The present study aimed to evaluate the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in terms of disease severity in Korea. METHODS: Totally two hundred patients with COPD were consecutively recruited in one tertiary hospital of Korea. Each respondent was asked to fill out the questionnaire through a face-to-face interview after providing informed consent. The questionnaire included general and clinical characteristics as well as the EQ-5D and Clinical COPD Questionnaire (CCQ). HRQoL was evaluated according to the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria and severity of breathlessness. RESULTS: The adjusted mean EQ-5D index scores were 0.83, 0.88, 0.81 and 0.60 in stage I, II, III and IV, respectively. The EQ-5D index tended to decrease with GOLD criteria. The adjusted mean EQ-Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores ranged from 65.1 in stage IV to 73.9 in stage I. The CCQ total scores deteriorated with an increasing GOLD stage and severity of breathlessness (all P < 0.001). The correlation between CCQ total score and EQ-5D index was -0.69. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that HRQoL in COPD measured by EQ-5D and CCQ worsens with the GOLD stage and severity of breathlessness. EQ-5D and CCQ could be useful instruments for an evaluation of HRQoL in COPD patients in Korea",10.1186/1477-7525-12-57
10728,Predicting EQ-5D utility scores from the Seattle Angina Questionnaire in coronary artery disease: a mapping algorithm using a Bayesian framework,Alberta; Algorithms; Angina Pectoris/diagnosis/pathology/psychology; Bayes Theorem; Confidence Intervals; Coronary Artery Disease/diagnosis/pathology/psychology; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Linear Models; Prognosis; Psychometrics; Quality of Life/psychology; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires,"BACKGROUND: The Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ), a descriptive quality of life instrument, is often used in coronary artery disease studies. In its current form, however, it cannot be used in economic evaluations. The investigators sought to create a mapping algorithm that would allow translation of SAQ scores into EQ-5D utility scores. METHODS: Data from the Alberta Provincial Project for Outcome Assessment in Coronary Heart Disease (APPROACH) database were used to examine the relationship between scores in each of the 5 domains of the SAQ (physical limitation, anginal stability, anginal frequency, treatment satisfaction, and disease perception) and the EQ-5D utility score. The cohort was divided into 80% derivation and 20% validation sets. Mapping algorithms were developed using simple linear regression and Tobit models. To account for the skewed distribution of the EQ-5D scores and the presence of heteroscedasticity, Bayesian extensions were applied to each model by specifying a nonconstant variance for the error term. Model performance was assessed by comparing predicted and observed mean EQ-5D scores in the validation set, and the unadjusted R2. RESULTS: The cohort consisted of 1992 patients. The simple linear regression model had the best predictive performance, with an R2 of 0.38. The nonconstant variance term did not improve overall performance for any of the models. The linear regression model accurately estimated the mean EQ-5D score in the validation set (predicted score 0.81 v. observed score 0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Mean EQ-5D utility weights can be accurately estimated from the SAQ using a simple linear regression mapping algorithm",10.1177/0272989X10386800

METHODS: We used data from the 2008 and 2010 Raising Healthy Eating and Active Living Kids in Alberta surveys of grade five students aged primarily 10-11 years and their parents in the Canadian province of Alberta We applied a random split sample approach. Two-thirds of the sample (modeling sample) was used for the estimation of the EQ-5D-Y VAS. The remaining one-third sample (validation sample) was used for the examination of the prediction accuracy of the estimation model. Multilevel linear regression was used to estimate EQ-5D-Y VAS score and produce EQ-5D-Y index values from the children's self-rated states described in the EQ-5D-Y and the accompanying VAS values RESULTS: The mean EQ-5D-Y VAS-based index value was 0.891 (SD 0.133) in the modeling sample and 0.885 (SD 0.134) in the validation sample. The own VAS-based index generally showed logical consistency, with lower values for health states that were logically worse. There was no statistically significant difference between the observed and the predicted VAS values in this sample. CONCLUSIONS: This study elicited a value set for health states defined by the EQ-5D-Y that is based on respondents' own VAS ratings from a large representative sample of Canadian children. Future study is needed to validate this type of value set among different age groups of children",10.1007/s11136-013-0479-5

This methodological systematic review describes the extent to which EQ-5D has been used in the evaluation of children's health care, assesses psychometric properties, and makes recommendations for future good practice. METHODS: Systematic searches of databases and the Internet to identify studies published during 2000-2010 that either used EQ-5D with children younger than age 19 years as an outcome measure or reported psychometric data. Study characteristics, including measures and psychometric data, were extracted into tables for analysis. RESULTS: We identified 29 studies that used four versions of the EQ-5D: adult EQ-5D, EQ-5D-Y, Dutch EQ-5D child, and extended with cognitive dimension, EQ-5D+C. Twelve of 29 studies did not specify the EQ-5D version used Existing literature lacks detail on the specific use of EQ-5D and its potential effects on findings. Version use and psychometric properties were inadequately reported. There are large gaps in current knowledge of psychometric properties across all versions when used with children. CONCLUSIONS: For reasons of comparability with resource use across adult and children's services, there are arguments for continued use of EQ-5D in studies with children. We recommend use of EQ-5D alongside children-specific quality of life measures and disease-specific measures. Researchers are encouraged to undertake methodological and philosophical analyses to better understand and improve evidence as to how adults who make decisions about resource allocation can best take account of children in decision making",10.1016/j.jval.2011.07.011

This review provides an overview of the different methods used to directly elicit strength of preference values: the standard gamble, time trade-off and rating scale methods. Methods used to derive utilities for patients' health states indirectly, and from a societal perspective are described. Three commonly used questionnaires: Health Utilities Index 3, EQ-5D and SF-6D are briefly commented upon. We also discuss the usefulness of utilities and advantages and disadvantages to be considered when choosing direct or indirect utility elicitation methods",10.1007/s00393-004-0658-4
5219,Does prevention-focused integration lead to the triple aim? An evaluation of two new care models in England,England; Health Status; Hospitalization; Humans; Primary Health Care; United Kingdom; integrated care; multimorbidity; new care models,"OBJECTIVES: To examine the effectiveness of two integrated care models ('vanguards') in Salford and South Somerset in England, United Kingdom, in relation to patient experience, health outcomes and costs of care (the 'triple aim'). METHODS: We used difference-in-differences analysis combined with propensity score weighting to compare the two care model sites with control ('usual care') areas in the rest of England. We estimated combined and separate annual effects in the three years following introduction of the new care model, using the national General Practice Patient Survey (GPPS) to measure patient experience (inter-organisational support with chronic condition management) and generic health status (EQ-5D); and hospital episode statistics (HES) data to measure total costs of secondary care. As secondary outcomes we measured proxies for improved prevention: cost per user of secondary care (severity); avoidable emergency admissions; and primary care utilisation. RESULTS: Both intervention sites showed an increase in total costs of secondary care (approximately £74 per registered patient per year in Salford, £45 in South Somerset) and cost per user of secondary care (£130-138 per person per year). There were no statistically significant effects on health status or patient experience of care. There was a more apparent short-term negative effect on measured outcomes in South Somerset, in terms of increased costs and avoidable emergency admissions, but these reduced over time. CONCLUSION: New care models such as those implemented within the Vanguard programme in England might lead to unintended secondary care cost increases in the short to medium term. Cost increases appeared to be driven by average patient severity increases in hospital. Prevention-focused population health management models of integrated care, like previous more targeted models, do not immediately improve the health system's triple aim",10.1177/1355819620963500

Patients with stable angina attending four cardiac out-patient clinics in the UK were included in the study. Data collected included information on patients' health-related quality of life (HRQL) using the EQ-5D, and severity of angina symptoms using two cardiac-specific measures [Breathlessness Grade and Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) classification of angina]. Regression analysis was used to predict EQ-5D index values from the data. Data were obtained from 510 patients. For CCS grades, mean EQ-5D scores ranged from 0.36 (95% confidence interval 0.25-0.48) for grade 4 to 0.81 (0.77-0.85) for grade 0, and for breathlessness grades, EQ-5D scores ranged from 0.31 (0.06-0.55) for grade 0 to 0.84 (0.79-0.88) for grade 5. The final model used data on CCS grades, breathlessness grades, and patients' current medications to predict EQ-5D scores. The model had an R2 value of 0.37, and predictions for less severe angina were considered more reliable than the estimates for severe angina. In the absence of utility data collected as part of a clinical trial it is possible to map HRQL utility data from samples of patients with similar characteristics to those in the original trial. The uncertainty surrounding the estimates should be considered when using the results to estimate QALYs for purposes of economic evaluation",10.1007/s10198-005-0309-y

It is an instrument with a multidimensional approach and a pragmatic purpose that allows rapid and efficient assessment of the degree of frailty in the context of clinical practice. Our aim was to investigate the convergent and discriminative validity of the Frail-VIG frailty index with regard to EQ-5D-3L value. METHODS: We carried out a cross-sectional study in two Primary Health Care (PHC) centres of the Catalan Institute of Health (Institut Català de la Salut), Barcelona (Spain) from February 2017 to January 2019. Participants in the study were all people included under a home care programme during the study period. No exclusion criteria were applied. We used the EQ-5D-3L to measure Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and the Frail-VIG index to measure frailty. Trained PHC nurses administered both instruments during face-to-face assessments in a participant's home during usual care. The relationships between both instruments were examined using Pearson's correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression analyses RESULTS: Four hundred and twelve participants were included in this study Frail-VIG score and EQ-5D-3L value were negatively correlated (r = - 0.510; P < 0.001). Non-frail people reported a substantially better HRQoL than people with moderate and severe frailty. EQ-5D-3L value declined significantly as the Frail-VIG index score increased. CONCLUSIONS: Frail-VIG index demonstrated a convergent validity with the EQ-5D-3L value. Its discriminative validity was optimal, as their scores showed an excellent capacity to differentiate between people with better and worse HRQoL. These findings provide additional pieces of evidence for construct validity of the Frail-VIG index",10.1186/s12877-021-02186-x

The objective of the study was to identify predictors associated with health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in diabetic patients. METHODS: A cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted at the General Hospital of the city of Leskovac, between June and November 2015. The Short Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire, EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) and EuroQol-VAS (EQ-VAS) questionnaires were used. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The total number of patients was 285, 112 men (39.3%) and 173 women (60.7%), average age 63.92 ± 1.07 years. The results of multiple linear regression of socio-demographic characteristics in relation to dimensions of the quality of life measured by SF-36 and EQ-VAS showed that age, country (rural) life, low level of education, retirement, and poor economic status are predictors of lower quality of life. Our results showed that employment has a significant association with higher Physical Component Score (PCS), Mental Component Score (MCS) and EQ-VAS score, which can be explained with higher incomes, improved economic status and less possibility for the occurrence of depressive mood. Patients without formal education have lower QOL. Univariate multiple regression analysis of the presence of micro- and macrovascular complications of DM showed that angina pectoris, heart failure, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic nephropathy are the most important factors affecting the quality of life in our population. After including the multivariate model, all tested complications remained statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Our results showed that both socioeconomic and chronic complications are relevant factors of HRQOL in type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Age, rural lifestyle, retirement, lower level of education and low socioeconomic status, as well as DM complications (angina pectoris, hearth failure, diabetes nephropathy, and diabetes retinopathy) were found to be independent risk factors for the component scores of SF-36 and EQ-VAS score. Taking into consideration the results obtained, health practitioners should be aware not only of the clinical parameters of patients with DM, but also of their educational level and working status",10.21101/cejph.a5022

At present, there are no quantitative studies on medication beliefs in patients with acromegaly. Here, we aimed to examine possible associations between medication beliefs, illness perceptions, and QoL. Furthermore we aimed to explore whether illness perceptions of patients with remission of acromegaly receiving medical treatment differ from patients without medical treatment. DESIGN: Cross-sectional evaluation of 73 patients with remission of acromegaly (n = 28 patients with medication, n = 45 without medication). The Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ), Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R), EuroQoL-5D, and AcroQoL were used for the assessment. RESULTS: Stronger beliefs about the necessity of medical treatment and stronger concerns about the adverse effects were associated with attributing more symptoms to acromegaly, perceiving more negative consequences, and having a stronger belief in a cyclical timeline (BMQ, all P < 0.05). Stronger beliefs about the necessity of medical treatment were associated with a worse disease-specific QoL (BMQ, P < 0.01). Patients with medical treatment perceived a more chronic timeline of their disease, compared to patients without medical treatment (IPQ-R, P = 0.002). CONCLUSION: Negative medication beliefs were related to more negative illness perceptions and worse disease-specific QoL. Patients receiving medical treatment for acromegaly tend to perceive a more chronic timeline of their disease, compared to patients with remission without medical treatment. These psychological factors need to be taken into account when treating patients and developing a psychosocial education program aiming to improve QoL",10.1016/j.ghir.2015.06.008
405,Does the Introduction of the Ranking Task in Valuation Studies Improve Data Quality and Reduce Inconsistencies? The Case of the EQ-5D-5L,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Analysis of Variance; Disability Evaluation; Female; Health Status; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Sickness Impact Profile; Spain; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult; health related quality of life; ranking, EQ-5D-5L; time trade off; valuation","BACKGROUND: Time trade-off (TTO)-based valuation studies for the three-level version of the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) typically started off with a ranking task (ordering the health states by preference). This was not included in the protocol for the five-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-5L) valuation study OBJECTIVES: To test whether reintroducing a ranking task before the composite TTO (C-TTO) could help to reduce inconsistencies in C-TTO responses and improve the data quality. METHODS: Respondents were randomly assigned to three study arms The control arm was the present EQ-5D-5L study protocol, without ranking. The second arm (ranking without sorting) preceded the present protocol by asking respondents to rank the target health states using physical cards. The states were then valued in random order using C-TTO. In the third arm (ranking and sorting), the ranked states remained visible through the C-TTO tasks and the order of valuation was determined by the ranking. The study used only 10 EQ-5D-5L health states. We compared the C-TTO-based inconsistent pairs of health states and ties. RESULTS: The final sample size was 196 in the control arm, 205 in the ranking without sorting arm, and 199 in the ranking and sorting arm. The percentages of ties by respondents were 15.1%, 12.5%, and 12.6% for the control arm, the ranking without sorting arm, and the ranking and sorting arm, respectively. The extra cost for adding the ranking task was about 15% CONCLUSIONS: The benefit does not justify the effort involved in the ranking task. For this reason, the addition of the ranking task to the present EQ-5D-5L valuation protocol is not an attractive option",10.1016/j.jval.2016.02.002

The importance of cardiovascular risks,Cardiovascular Diseases/complications/physiopathology; Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Mellitus/physiopathology; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Risk Factors,"BACKGROUND: To analyse and compare the impact of cardiovascular risk factors and disease on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in people with and without diabetes living in the community. METHODS: We used data of 1,905 people with diabetes and 19,031 people without diabetes from the last Spanish National Health Survey (years 2011-2012). The HRQoL instrument used was the EuroQol 5D-5L, based on time trade-off scores. Matching methods were used to assess any differences in the HRQoL in people with and without diabetes with the same characteristics (age, gender, education level, and healthy lifestyle), according to cardiovascular risk factors and diseases. Disparities were also analysed for every dimension of HRQoL: mobility, daily activities, personal care, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in time trade-off scores between people with and without diabetes when cardiovascular risk factors or established cardiovascular disease were not present. However, when cardiovascular risk factors were present, the HRQoL score was significantly lower in people with diabetes than in those without. This difference was indeed greater when cardiovascular diseases were present. More precisely, people with diabetes and any of the cardiovascular risk factors, who have not yet developed any cardiovascular disease, report lower HRQoL, 0.046 TTO score points over 1 (7.93 over 100 in the VAS score) compared to those without diabetes, and 0.14 TTO score points of difference (14.61 over 100 in the VAS score) if cardiovascular diseases were present. In fact, when the three risk factors were present in people with diabetes, HRQoL was significantly lower (0.10 TTO score points over 1 and 10.86 points over 100 in VAS score), obesity being the most influential risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of established cardiovascular disease and/or cardiovascular risk factors, specially obesity, account for impaired quality of life in people with diabetes",10.1371/journal.pone.0189505

METHODS: Prospective nationwide registry. Participants with diabetes mellitus (DM) used the FSL-FGM system for a period of 12 months. End points included changes in HbA1c, hypoglycemia, health-related quality of life (12-Item Short Form Health Survey(v2) (SF-12(v2)) and 3-level version of EuroQol 5D (EQ-5D-3L)), a specifically developed patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) questionnaire, diabetes-related hospital admission rate and work absenteeism Measurements were performed at baseline, and after 6 months and 12 months RESULTS: 1365 persons (55% male) were included. Mean age was 46 (16) years, 77% of participants had type 1 DM, 16% type 2 DM and 7% other forms. HbA1c decreased from 64 (95%CI 63 to 65) mmol/mol to 60 (95%CI 60 to 61) mmol/mol with a difference of -4 (95% CI -6 to 3) mmol/mol. Persons with a baseline HbA1c >70 mmol/mol had the most profound HbA1c decrease: -9 (95% CI -12 to to 5) mmol/mol. EQ-5D tariff (0.03 (95%CI 0.01 to 0.05)), EQ-VAS (4.4 (95%CI 2.1 to 6.7)) and SF-12(v2) mental component score (3.3 (95%CI 2.1 to 4.4)) improved. For most, PROMs improved. Work absenteeism rate (/6 months) and diabetes-related hospital admission rate (/year) decreased significantly, from 18.5% to 7.7% and 13.7% to 2.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Real world data demonstrate that use of FSL-FGM results in improved well-being and decreased disease burden, as well as improvement of glycemic control",10.1136/bmjdrc-2019-000809
8826,Chronic low back pain and the risk of depression or anxiety symptoms: insights from a longitudinal twin study,"Adult; Depression/epidemiology/etiology/genetics; Female; Humans; Low Back Pain/complications/epidemiology/genetics; Male; Middle Aged; Twins, Dizygotic; Twins, Monozygotic; Anxiety; Chronic low back pain; Depression; Epidemiology; Genetics; Twins","BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Pain is commonly associated with symptoms of depression or anxiety, although this relationship is considered bidirectional. There is limited knowledge regarding causal relationships. PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate whether chronic low back pain (LBP) increases the risk of depression or anxiety symptoms, after adjusting for shared familial factors. STUDY DESIGN: This is a longitudinal, genetically informative study design from the Murcia Twin Registry in Spain. PATIENT SAMPLE: The patient sample included 1,269 adult twins with a mean age of 53 years. OUTCOME MEASURES: The outcome of depression or anxiety symptoms was evaluated with EuroQol questionnaire. METHODS: Using logistic regression analyses, twins were initially assessed as individuals in the total sample analysis, followed by a co-twin case-control, which was partially (dizygotic [DZ] twins) and fully (monozygotic [MZ] twins) adjusted for shared familial factors. There was no external funding for this study and no conflict of interest was declared. RESULTS: There was a significant association between chronic LBP and the risk of depression or anxiety symptoms in the unadjusted total sample analysis (odds ratio [OR]: 1.81, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.34-2.44). After adjusting for confounders, the association remained significant (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.05-1.95), although the adjusted co-twin case-control was non-significant in DZ (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.50-2.13) and MZ twins (OR: 1.86, 95% CI: 0.63-5.51). CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between chronic LBP and the future development of depression or anxiety symptoms is not causal. The relationship is likely to be explained by confounding from shared familial factors, given the non-statistically significant associations in the co-twin case-control analyses",10.1016/j.spinee.2017.02.009

DESIGN. Cross-sectional, descriptive study using personal interviews. SETTING: Three health districts in Cordoba city, Spain PARTICIPANTS: A stratified sample of 362 people over 70. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: The assessment tools were the WHO questionnaire for the study of falls and the EuroQol-5D for the measurement of health-related quality of life. Uni-bivariate and multivariate analyses (P< .05) were run. RESULTS: The prevalence of falls was 31.78% (95% CI, 26.99%-36.6%); 12.98% of subjects had more than one fall in the previous year; 55.3% of falls happened at home; 71.8% of the falls had physical consequences, with 7.8% fractures; 44.7% of the elderly studied were scared of having a new fall, and 22% limited their mobility after the fall. In 30% of cases there was contact with the health system, and 3.3% needed hospital admission. The factors related to a greater risk of falls were: being older, being a woman, widowed, uneducated, with difficulties in moving both arms, suffering space disorientation, high drug consumption, and having worse perceived health status CONCLUSIONS: Falls in the elderly living in the community are a frequent problem, with important physical, psychological and social consequences",10.1157/13094802

The utilization of generic and disease specific QoL questionnaires in the same population may provide a better understanding of the significance of nutrition in QoL dimensions. OBJECTIVE: To assess nutritional status by easy to use parameters and to evaluate the potential relationship with QoL measured by generic and disease specific questionnaires METHODS: Nutritional status was assessed by subjective global assessment adapted to renal patients (SGA), body mass index (BMI), nutritional intake and appetite QoL was assessed by the generic EuroQoL and disease specific Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form (KDQoL-SF) questionnaires. RESULTS: The study comprised 130 patients of both genders, mean age 62.7 ± 14.7 years. The prevalence of undernutrition ranged from 3.1% by BMI ≤ 18.5 kg/m² to 75.4% for patients below energy and protein intake recommendations. With the exception of BMI classification, undernourished patients had worse scores in nearly all QoL dimensions (EuroQoL and KDQoL-SF), a pattern which was dominantly maintained when adjusted for demographics and disease-related variables. Overweight/ obese patients (BMI ≥ 25) also had worse scores in some QoL dimensions, but after adjustment the pattern was maintained only in the symptoms and problems dimension of KDQoL-SF (p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that even in mildly undernourished HD patients, nutritional status has a significant impact in several QoL dimensions. The questionnaires used provided different, almost complementary perspectives, yet for daily practice EuroQoL is simpler. Assuring a good nutritional status, may positively influence QoL",10.3305/nh.2013.28.3.6454

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a cross-sectional study including 967 adult participants, the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule version 2.0 36-item version was used for assessing overall and domain-specific disability as outcome variables. Patients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), EuroQoL EQ-5D-5L and questions about multi-morbidity, smoking and perceived physical fitness. Additionally, the main health condition, sociodemographic and environmental variables obtained from referrals and public registers were used as predictor variables. Descriptive statistics and linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The mean (standard error) overall disability score was 30.0 (0.5), domain scores ranged from 11.9 to 44.7. Neurological diseases, multi-morbidity, low education, impaired physical fitness, pain, and higher HADS depressive score increased the overall disability score. A low HADS depressive score predicted a lower disability score in all domains. CONCLUSIONS: A moderate overall disability score was found among patients accepted for admission to a rehabilitation center but ""life activities"" and ""participation in society"" had the highest domain scores This should be taken into account when rehabilitation strategies are developed",10.1371/journal.pone.0193761

The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of adjunct AF surgery as currently performed on sinus rhythm (SR) restoration, survival, QoL and cost-effectiveness. METHODS: In a multicentre, Phase III, pragmatic, double-blinded, parallel-armed randomized controlled trial, 352 cardiac surgery patients with >3 months of documented AF were randomized to surgery with or without adjunct maze or similar AF ablation between 2009 and 2014. Primary outcomes were SR restoration at 1 year and quality-adjusted life years at 2 years. Secondary outcomes included SR at 2 years, overall and stroke-free survival, medication, QoL, cost-effectiveness and safety. RESULTS: More ablation patients were in SR at 1 year [odds ratio (OR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.20-3.54; P = 0.009]. At 2 years, the OR increased to 3.24 (95% CI 1.76-5.96). Quality-adjusted life years were similar at 2 years (ablation - control -0.025, P = 0.6319). Significantly fewer ablation patients were anticoagulated from 6 months postoperatively. Stroke rates were 5.7% (ablation) and 9.1% (control) (P = 0.3083). There was no significant difference in stroke-free survival [hazard ratio (HR) = 0.99, 95% CI 0.64-1.53; P = 0.949] nor in serious adverse events, operative or overall survival, cardioversion, pacemaker implantation, New York Heart Association, EQ-5D-3L and SF-36. The mean additional ablation cost per patient was £3533 (95% CI £1321-£5746). Cost-effectiveness was not demonstrated at 2 years. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunct AF surgery is safe and increases SR restoration and costs but not survival or QoL up to 2 years. A continued follow-up will provide information on these outcomes in the longer term. STUDY REGISTRATION: ISRCTN82731440 (project number 07/01/34)",10.1093/ejcts/ezy165
9582,A Mobile Phone-Based Telemonitoring Program for Heart Failure Patients After an Incidence of Acute Decompensation (Medly-AID): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial,heart failure; mobile phone; patient monitoring; randomized controlled trial; telemedicine,"BACKGROUND: Patients with heart failure (HF) are at the highest risk for hospital readmissions during the first few weeks after discharge when patients are transitioning from hospital to home. Telemonitoring (TM) for HF management has been found to reduce mortality risk and hospital readmissions if implemented appropriately; however, the impact of TM targeted for patients recently discharged from hospital, for whom TM might have the biggest benefit, is still unknown. Medly, a mobile phone-based TM system that is currently being used as a standard of care for HF at a large Canadian hospital, may be an effective tool for the management of HF in patients recently discharged from hospital OBJECTIVE: The objective of the Medly-After an Incidence of acute Decompensation (Medly-AID) trial is to determine the effect of Medly on the self-care and quality of life of patients with HF who have been recently discharged from hospital after an HF-related decompensation. METHODS: A multisite multimethod randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted at 2 academic hospitals and at least one community hospital to evaluate the impact of Medly-enabled HF management on the outcomes of patients with HF who had been hospitalized for HF-related decompensation and discharged during the 2 weeks before recruitment The trial will include 144 participants with HF (74 in each control and intervention groups). Control patients will receive standard of care, whereas patients in the intervention group will receive standard of care and Medly Specifically, patients in the intervention group will record daily weight, blood pressure, and heart rate and answer symptom-related questions via the Medly app Medly will generate automated patient self-care messages such as to adjust diuretic medications, based on the rules-based algorithm personalized to the individual patient, and send real-time alerts to their health care providers as necessary. All patients will be followed for 3 months. Primary outcome measures are self-care and quality of life as measured through the validated questionnaires Self-Care of Heart Failure Index, EQ-5D-5L, and the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-12. Secondary outcome measures for this study include cost of health care services used and health outcomes. RESULTS: Patient recruitment began in November 2018 at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, with a total of 35 participants recruited by July 30, 2019 (17 in the intervention group and 18 in the control group). The final analysis is expected to occur in the fall of 2020. CONCLUSIONS: This RCT will be the first to assess the effectiveness of the Medly TM system for use following discharge from hospital after a HF-related decompensation.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted at a level I trauma center of patients with a displaced intra-articular calcaneal fracture treated from January 1, 2002 to December 31, 2011. The patient-reported outcome measures included the Foot Function Index, American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot scale, Short Form-36, the EQ-5D from the EuroQol Group, and a 10-point visual analog scale. Clinical data were collected from 169 patients, and questionnaires were obtained from 78 patients (18 nonoperatively, 27 ORIF, and 33 percutaneously). The late intervention rate was significantly greater in the percutaneous group (n = 18; 30%) than in the ORIF group (n = 6; 12%) or the nonoperative group (n = 8; 13%; p = .030). Significantly more disability was reported in the nonoperative group (median Foot Function Index score, 40 points) than in the ORIF group (median, 16 points; p = .010) or in the percutaneous group (median, 21 points; p = .034). In conclusion, the operatively treated patients (ORIF and percutaneous treatment) reported better functional outcome scores (Foot Function Index and American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society hindfoot scale) than did the nonoperatively treated patients",10.1053/j.jfas.2014.04.014

The aim of this study was to examine the influence of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) on the health-related quality of life (HRQL) and on quality-adjusted life years (QALY). The EQ-5D-3L questionnaire was used to determine the HRQL. After three cross-sectional examinations at intervals of 1 yr, the longitudinal development of QALY was compared by repeated-measurement analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). The cohort was split at the 95th percentile of the comparison group for each PCB congener; known confounders such as age were taken into account. A significant difference in height and development of QALY over time was shown for the higher chlorinated non-dioxin-like PCB (hcPCB) congeners. A significant between-groups effect was found on PCB 153, PCB 180, and the sum of hcPCB. It was found that QALY decreased in the high-burden group and QALY stabilized after yr 2 in the normal-burden group. Taking the dimensions of the EQ-5D into account, the between-groups effect seems to be based predominantly on the dimension anxiety. The development of the within-group effect, however, seems to be based on the dimension mobility. This study detected a significant influence of hcPCB on the development of HRQL and QALYs over time according to the level of internal PCB burden",10.1080/15287394.2014.946165

Only few measures exist to identify work addiction and the health consequences are sparsely explored. The Bergen Workaholic Scale (BWAS) measures seven core elements of work addiction and has been used in Norway, Hungary, Brazil, Italy, USA and Poland. The aim of this study was to validate the BWAS in a Danish sample and to investigate if high risk of work addiction was associated with stress and reduced quality of life. We conducted an online screening survey with 671 participants aged 16-68 years with the Danish translation of the BWAS We added the perceived stress scale (PSS) and the quality of life scale EQ-5D-5L Those with high risk of work addiction reported significantly higher mean PSS scores (20.0 points) compared to those with low risk of addiction (12.5 points) and poorer quality of life (61.9) compared to the low risk group (81.3) Furthermore, work addiction was associated with more weekly working hours (44.0 vs. 35.6 hours/week) and having more leadership responsibility. A preliminary estimate of work addiction prevalence was 6.6%. The BWAS demonstrated good reliability (α = 0.83), and factor analyses pointed at a single factor structure Work addiction seems to be associated with health problems in terms of stress and poorer quality of life. The BWAS is recommended as a reliable and valid tool to identify work addiction in Danish",10.1111/sjop.12506

We compared the effect on QoL of two docetaxel-platinum regimens with vinorelbine-cisplatin. METHODS: QoL was assessed by the Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) and the general EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D) in 926 chemotherapy-naïve patients with stages IIIB to IV NSCLC. Patients were randomly assigned to receive: docetaxel 75 mg/m2 plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2, every 3 weeks (DC); docetaxel 75 mg/m2 and carboplatin 6 mg/ml min, every 3 weeks (DCb); or vinorelbine 25 mg/m2/week plus cisplatin 100 mg/m2, every 4 weeks (VC). RESULTS: Overall, patients treated with either docetaxel-containing regimen had better QoL than VC-treated patients (LCSS global item ""QoL today"": P=0.064 for DC and P=0.016 for DCb versus VC; EQ-5D global item ""health state today"": P=0.016 for DC and P<0.001 for DCb versus VC). DC-treated patients experienced improved pain relief compared with VC (P=0.033), whereas pain relief with DCb and VC was similar. Patients treated with either docetaxel regimen had more favorable changes in performance status (P=0.065 for DC and P<0.001 for DCb versus VC) and mean weight loss (0.06 kg, gain of 0.08 kg, and 2.27 kg for DC, DCb, and VC, respectively; P<0.001 for both DC versus VC and DCb versus VC). CONCLUSION: The TAX 326 study shows that docetaxel-platinum regimens relieve symptoms and improve QoL in patients with advanced NSCLC. DCb and DC were superior to VC in all QoL outcomes assessed except for the difference between DC and VC in LCSS ""QoL today"", which was not significant",10.1016/j.lungcan.2006.05.003

METHODS: From 2008 to 2017, 215 patients (mean age 57 yrs (17 to 18), 61% female (n = 130/215)) with a nonoperatively managed humeral diaphyseal fracture were retrospectively identified. Union was achieved in 77% (n = 165/215) after initial nonoperative management, with 23% (n = 50/215) uniting after surgery for nonunion. The EuroQol five-dimension three-level health index (EQ-5D-3L) was obtained via postal survey. Multiple regression was used to determine the independent influence of patient, injury, and management factors upon the EQ-5D-3L. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of < £20,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained was considered cost-effective RESULTS: At a mean of 5.4 yrs (1.2 to 11.0), the mean EQ-5D-3L was 0.736 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.697 to 0.775). Adjusted analysis demonstrated the EQ-5D-3L was inferior among patients who united after nonunion surgery (β = 0.103; p = 0.032). Offering routine fixation to all patients to reduce the rate of nonunion would be associated with increased treatment costs of £1,542/patient, but would confer a potential EQ-5D-3L benefit of 0.120/patient over the study period. The ICER of routine fixation was £12,850/QALY gained. Selective fixation based on a RUSHU < 8 at six weeks post-injury would be associated with reduced treatment costs (£415/patient), and would confer a potential EQ-5D-3L benefit of 0.335 per 'at-risk patient'. CONCLUSION: Routine fixation for patients with humeral shaft fractures to reduce the rate of nonunion observed after nonoperative management appears to be a cost-effective intervention at five years post-injury. Selective fixation for patients at risk of nonunion based on their RUSHU may confer even greater cost-effectiveness, given the potential savings and improvement in health-related quality of life.

15245,How to Evaluate Health-Related Quality of Life and Its Association with Medication Adherence in Pulmonary Tuberculosis - Designing a Prospective Observational Study in South Africa,South Africa; adherence; health-related quality of life; study design; tuberculosis,"INTRODUCTION: Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has become an important measure to identify and shape effective and patient-relevant healthcare interventions innovations through outcomes. Adherence to tuberculosis (TB) treatment is a public health concern. The main objective of this research is to develop a study design for evaluation of HRQOL and its association with medication adherence in TB in South Africa. METHODOLOGY: A conceptual framework for HRQOL in TB has been developed to identify Patient-Reported Outcomes and Quality of Life Database (PROQOLID), (n.d.) measures for HRQOL and adherence and to generate an endpoint model. Two generic (SF-12 and EQ-5D-5L), one disease-specific (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire) and one condition-specific (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) measure for HRQOL and Morisky Medication Adherence Scale for adherence assessment were identified. All measures are applied in a longitudinal multi-center study at five data collection time points during standard TB treatment. Statistical analysis includes multivariable analysis. Change over time in the physical component score of SF-12 is defined as primary endpoint. Sample size estimation based thereupon has led to a recruitment target of 96 patients. This study is on-going. DISCUSSION: This is the first longitudinal study in South Africa which evaluates HRQOL and its association with medication adherence in TB in a comprehensive manner. Results will help to improve current treatment programs and medication adherence and will support the identification of sustainable health innovations in TB, determining the value of new products, and supporting decision making with regard to health policy and pricing",10.3389/fphar.2016.00125

METHODS: We performed a follow-up survey in 20 CVD patients using the Life-Space Assessment (LSA) scale and the five-level EuroQoL five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L), Japanese version, at three time points: January-March 2020 (before the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic), July 2020 (following the first wave of the pandemic), and November 2020 (following the second wave of the pandemic). RESULTS: The LSA score in November 2020 (median [interquartile range], 90 [83.5-100] points) did not recover from the July 2020 score (83 [76.5-93] points). However, the EQ-5D-5L QoL score in November 2020 (0.89 [0.82-1]) had improved from that in July 2020 (0.80 [0.71-0.87]). CONCLUSION: The QoL of CVD patients might have been more affected by psychological factors rather than physical factors during the first two waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan",10.2174/1574887117666220119122939

The aim of this study was to provide a range of estimates of minimally important differences (MIDs) in EQ-5D scores in cancer and to determine if estimates are comparable in lung cancer. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on cross-sectional data collected from 534 cancer patients, 50 of whom were lung cancer patients. A range of minimally important differences (MIDs) in EQ-5D index-based utility (UK and US) scores and VAS scores were estimated using both anchor-based and distribution-based (1/2 standard deviation and standard error of the measure) approaches. Groups were anchored using Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) ratings and FACT-G total score-based quintiles. RESULTS: For UK-utility scores, MID estimates based on PS ranged from 0.10 to 0.12 both for all cancers and for lung cancer subgroup. Using FACT-G quintiles, MIDs were 0.09 to 0.10 for all cancers, and 0.07 to 0.08 for lung cancer. For US-utility scores, MIDs ranged from 0.07 to 0.09 grouped by PS for all cancers and for lung cancer; when based on FACT-G quintiles, MIDs were 0.06 to 0.07 in all cancers and 0.05 to 0.06 in lung cancer MIDs for VAS scores were similar for lung and all cancers, ranging from 8 to 12 (PS) and 7 to 10 (FACT-G quintiles). DISCUSSION: Important differences in EQ-5D utility and VAS scores were similar for all cancers and lung cancer, with the lower end of the range of estimates closer to the MID, i.e. 0.08 for UK-index scores, 0.06 for US-index scores, and 7 [corrected] for VAS scores",10.1186/1477-7525-5-70

Previous research has suggested that extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT) may induce angiogenesis in treated tissue. The objective of this feasibility pilot trial was to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ESWT as a novel treatment. METHODS: Patients with unilateral claudication were randomized to receive ESWT or sham treatment to the calf muscle three times per week for 3 weeks. Primary outcomes were pain-free walking distance (PFWD) and maximum walking distance (MWD). Secondary outcomes included safety and tolerability of ESWT treatment, ankle-brachial index before and after exercise, and quality of life assessed using generic (36-Item Short Form Health Survey, EuroQol-5 Dimension 3-Level) and disease-specific (Vascular Quality of Life) instruments. Participants were assessed at baseline and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after treatment. Feasibility outcomes included recruitment and attendance rates for treatment and follow-up. RESULTS: Thirty patients were recruited in total Statistically significant (P < .05) improvements at all time points were observed in the active treatment group for both MWD and PFWD compared with the sham treatment group. PFWD improved by 276% in the active group and MWD improved by 167% in the active group at 12 weeks after treatment. There were no immediate or delayed treatment safety concerns or documented adverse effects of treatment with ESWT in this trial. CONCLUSIONS: ESWT is safe and well tolerated when it is applied to the calf and demonstrated significant improvements in walking distances. Current conservative management of intermittent claudication includes supervised exercise. The early results with ESWT as an alternative, noninvasive treatment option show great potential. The mechanism of action, durability of the clinical effect, and cost-effectiveness of ESWT for claudication require further investigation",10.1016/j.jvs.2017.07.105

METHODS: We evaluated patients who underwent surgery for spondylolisthesis. The QALY was determined from the EQ5D. Outcomes were also assessed using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Surgical, neuromonitoring, and anesthesia Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes as well as hospital Diagnosis-Related Group codes were used to determine the Medicare direct care costs of surgery. Indirect costs were modeled based on existing literature. A discounting rate of 3% was applied. Analysis was performed to determine which factors were associated with a cost/QALY less than $100,000. RESULTS: There were 44 patients who underwent surgery for either degenerative (30) or isthmic spondylolisthesis (14). There were 27 women and 17 men, with an average age at surgery of 59.7 years (standard deviation [SD] = 14.69) and an average follow-up of 2 years (SD = 0.82). The average postoperative improvement in ODI was 24.77 (SD = 23.9), and change in QALY was 0.43 (SD = 0.30). The average cost/QALY at 2 years for direct care costs was $89,065. The average cost/QALY at 2 years for direct plus indirect costs was $112,588. Higher preoperative leg pain and greater leg pain change was associated with a cost/QALY <$100,000 (p < .005, p < .028). The cost-effective group had a higher proportion of patients with disease extent of two or more levels (p = .021). When comparing surgical techniques of anterior-posterior and posterior only, there was no difference in cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Spondylolisthesis surgery is cost-effective at 2 years, with a QALY change of 0.43 and a direct cost/QALY of $89,065. Higher preoperative leg pain and larger extent of disease was associated with cost-effectiveness. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: IV",10.1016/j.jspd.2015.05.006
8535,Comparison of clinical and echocardiographic outcomes and quality of life in patients with severe mitral regurgitation treated by MitraClip implantation or treated conservatively,MitraClip; heart failure; mitral regurgitation; quality of life,"INTRODUCTION: The most common alternative method of treatment for patients with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) is the implantation of a MitraClip device. AIM: To evaluate clinical and echocardiographic outcomes and quality of life (QoL) in patients with severe secondary MR, disqualified from surgical intervention, treated by implantation of a MitraClip in comparison to conservative therapy MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 33 patients were included. Patients were stratified by treatment method: group A, MitraClip implantation (n = 10); group B, conservative treatment (n = 23). Clinical, echocardiographic, and QoL (EQ-5D-3L, SF-12v2 Health Survey) characteristics were compared at baseline and at follow-up of 8.0 ±2.3 months. RESULTS: In group A, 2 deaths were observed: one patient died 7 days after MitraClip implantation, and the second patient died 4 months after the procedure. No cases of rehospitalization were reported. In group B, 4 (17.4%) deaths and 6 (26.1%) hospitalizations were reported. After MitraClip implantation a significant reduction of the NYHA class (p = 0.02), decrease in grade of MR (p = 0.01), vena contracta width (p = 0.006), effective regurgitant orifice area (EROA) (p = 0.003), regurgitant volume (p = 0.03) and end-diastolic left ventricle diameter (p = 0.02) as well as an improvement in QoL were reported. There were no significant changes in the NYHA class and QoL in the group treated conservatively. In those patients, we observed increased intercommissural mitral annulus diameter (p = 0.03), left atrium diameter (p = 0.002), and right ventricle dimension (p = 0.008), more severe tricuspid regurgitation (p = 0.02) and lower mitral annular plane systolic excursion (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with severe secondary MR treated with the MitraClip achieved a significant reduction in symptoms and MR grade, as well as an improvement in QoL, as compared to patients treated conservatively",10.5114/aic.2018.78334

Multiple psychiatric symptoms (MPS) have many negative effects on quality of life of the patient as well as on caregiver burden and competence. Irrespective of the effectiveness of an intervention programme, it is important to take into account its economic aspects. METHODS: The economic evaluation was performed alongside a single open RCT and conducted between 2001 and 2006. The patients who met the selection criteria were asked to participate in the RCT. After the patient or his caregiver signed a written informed consent form, he was then randomly assigned to either IRR or UC.The costs and effects of IRR were compared to those of UC. We assessed the cost-utility of IRR as well as the cost-effectiveness of both conditions. Primary outcome variable: severity of MPS (NPI) of patients; secondary outcome variables: general caregiver burden (CB) and caregiver competence (CCL), quality of life (EQ5D) of the patient, and total medical costs per patient (TiC-P). Cost-utility was evaluated on the basis of differences in total medical costs). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated by comparing differences of total medical costs and effects on NPI, CB and CCL (Incremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio: ICER). CEAC-analyses were performed for QALY and NPI-severity. All significant testing was fixed at p<0.05 (two-tailed) The data were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat (ITT)-principle. A complete cases approach (CC) was used. RESULTS: IRR turned out to be non-significantly, 10.5% more expensive than UC (€ 36 per day). The number of QALYs was 0.01 higher (non-significant) in IRR, resulting in € 276,290 per QALY According to the ICER-method, IRR was significantly more cost-effective on NPI-sum-severity of the patient (up to 34%), CB and CCL (up to 50%), with ICERs varying from € 130 to € 540 per additional point of improvement. CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were found on QALYs. In IRR patients improved significantly more on severity of MPS, and caregivers on general burden and competence, with incremental costs varying from € 130 to € 540 per additional point of improvement. The surplus costs of IRR are considered acceptable, taking into account the high societal costs of suffering from MPS of psychogeriatric patients and the high burden of caregivers. The large discrepancy in economic evaluation between QALYs (based on EQ5D) and ICERs (based on clinically relevant outcomes) demands further research on the validity of EQ5D in psychogeriatric cost-utility studies.

7664,Factors associated with influenza vaccine coverage among patients with diabetes: Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2016-2018,Diabetes; Influenza vaccination coverage; South Korea,"BACKGROUND: Although the influenza vaccine has been proven to be effective, this common disease has high morbidity and mortality rates. Moreover, adults with diabetes are at a high risk of influenza-mediated morbidity and mortality PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: With the increasing prevalence of diabetes, influenza is more lethal in diabetics; thus, we aimed to investigate the factors associated with influenza vaccination coverage in patients with diabetes. METHODS: Cross-sectional data were obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2016-2018). We retrospectively analyzed whether sociodemographic, health-related, and medical factors are associated with influenza vaccination coverage in patients with diabetes. We performed a complex sample logistic regression analysis and estimated the odds ratios (ORs) by adjusting for statistically significant factors. RESULTS: The number of survey subjects was 18,553. The vaccine coverage rate among patients with diabetes was 60.6%. In the univariate analysis, sex, educational level, smoking, exercise, drinking, marital status, private health insurance, activity limit, economic activity, age, and EuroQol-5 Dimension scores, which were used to assess health-related quality of life, were associated with vaccination coverage. In the multivariate analysis, only age and economic activity were associated with vaccination coverage. The vaccination coverage rate was higher for people who did not undertake economic activities and who were older (OR 1.512 (1.087-2.105), OR 2.212 (1.822-2.686), respectively, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: National interventions involving public health centers are necessary to encourage influenza immunization for patients with diabetes, especially younger patients and those who work or undertake economic activities",10.1007/s13410-021-00977-x

METHODS: In this cross-sectional observational study, EuroQol-5 Dimension- 5 Level (EQ-5D-5L), EuroQol Visual Analog Scale (EQ-VAS), and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Prostate (FACT-P) measures were used to examine utility, VAS scores, and disease-specific HRQoL, respectively. Scores obtained were statistically examined for the correlation among measures and domains. Parameter estimates of statistically significant factors were assessed using generalized linear models (GLM). RESULTS: A total of 380 patients stratified by their disease progression status were analyzed. The numbers (%) of patients in groups stratified as having localized (L), localized progression (LP), distant metastatic (DM), and DM-castration-resistant PC (CRPC) were 275 (72.4), 40 (10.5), 27 (7.1), and 38 (10.0), respectively. EQ-5D-5L mean (standard deviation, SD) scores of L, LP, DM, and DM-CRPC in study participants were 0.87 (0.15), 0.86 (0.15), 0.85 (0.18), and 0.84 (0.17), respectively. The mean (SD) scores assessed by EQ-5D-5L, EQ-VAS, and FACT-P instruments were 0.86 (0.16), 74.6 (16.8), and 110.8 (19.6), respectively. Utility scores correlated well with FACT-P scores Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status had significant influences on all instruments' scores. CONCLUSIONS: We obtained health utility and HRQoL scores of Japanese PC patients stratified by disease progression in detail. Our results will be useful for establishing cost-effectiveness analyses in Japanese PC settings",10.1007/s11136-019-02184-y

No licensed antimyotonic treatment has been available until approval of mexiletine (NaMuscla®) for adult patients by the EMA in December 2018. This Delphi panel aimed to understand how outcomes of the pivotal phase III Mexiletine study (MYOMEX) translate to real world practice and investigate health resource use, quality of life and the natural history of NDM to support economic modelling and facilitate patient access. METHODS: Nine clinical experts in treating NDM took part in a two-round Delphi panel. Their knowledge of NDM and previous use of mexiletine as an off-label treatment prior to NaMuscla's approval ensured they could provide both qualitative context and quantitative estimates to support economic modelling comparing mexiletine (NaMuscla) to best supportive care Consensus in four key areas was sought: healthcare resource utilization (HRU), treatment with mexiletine (NaMuscla), patient quality of life (QoL), and the natural history of disease. Concept questions were also asked, considering perceptions on the feasibility of mapping the validated Individualized Neuromuscular Quality of Life (INQoL) instrument to the generic EQ-5D™, and the potential impact on caregiver QoL. RESULTS: Consensus was achieved for key questions including the average long-term dosage of mexiletine (NaMuscla) in practice, the criteria for eligibility of myotonia treatment, the clinical importance of QoL outcomes in MYOMEX, the higher proportion of patients with increased QoL, and the reduction in the need for mental health resources for patients receiving mexiletine (NaMuscla). While consensus was not achieved for other questions, the results demonstrated that most experts felt mexiletine (NaMuscla) reduced the need for HRU and was expected to improve QoL. The QoL mapping exercise suggested that it is feasible to map domains of INQoL to EQ-5D Points of interest for future research were identified, including that mexiletine (NaMuscla) may slow the annual decrease in QoL of patients over their lifetime, and a significant negative impact on QoL for some caregivers. CONCLUSIONS: This project successfully provided data from an informed group of clinical experts, complementing the currently available clinical trial data for mexiletine (NaMuscla) to support patient access decisions",10.1186/s12883-021-02491-3

AIM: To investigate the long term change of health status in subjects with mild to moderate airflow obstruction and to compare this to subjects without airflow obstruction, with and without a smoking history Second, to investigate the factors potentially associated to rapid health status decline in our total cohort. METHODS: Two hundred and one subjects were included Generic [Short form 36 health survey (SF36) and EuroQol - 5 dimensions (EQ-5D)] and disease specific [Clinical COPD questionnaire (CCQ) and COPD Assessment Test (CAT)] health status questionnaires were regularly repeated over a six years period. Other functional outcomes comprised measures of lung function, physical fitness, physical activity and emotional state. RESULTS: On average, health status decline did not differ between groups with the exception of the EQ-5D index, which deteriorated faster in subjects with airflow obstruction compared to the never smoking control group [- 0.018(0.008) versus 0.00006(0.003), p = 0.03] Subjects presenting at least one exacerbation had faster rate of deterioration measured with CAT [0.91(0.21) versus - 0.26(0.25), p < 0.01]. Characteristics of the fast declining group were older age, worse lung function, physical fitness, physical activity and disease specific baseline health status. Subjects with airflow obstruction had a 2.5 (95% CI 1.36-4.71) higher risk of presenting fast overall health status decline. Fast overall decline was associated with the presence of acute exacerbation(s) (44% of the subjects with exacerbation(s) versus 17% of subjects without exacerbation, p = 0.03). Changes in fat free mass, functional exercise capacity and in symptoms of anxiety and depression correlated weakly to changes in health status measured with all questionnaires. CONCLUSION: Subjects with mild airflow obstruction present a significant deterioration of health status, which is generally not much faster compared to smoking and never smoking controls. Subjects with fast decline in overall health status are older and more likely to have airflow obstruction, acute respiratory exacerbation(s), reduced physical fitness, physical activity and impaired COPD specific health status at baseline.

STUDY DESIGN: An economic analysis was performed on 69 women receiving surgical treatment for urinary incontinence using suburethral slings and prolapse meshes. To calculate the procedure's cost-effectiveness, an incremental analysis up to one year was performed using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). The costs were calculated using a cost-by-process model. Answers to the health-related quality of life questionnaires EQ-5D (generic) and International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire Short-form (specific) were collected before the operation and as well as one month and one year post-operation to calculate the utility, using quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and the effectiveness, respectively. To complete the economic evaluation, we derived confidence ellipses and acceptability curves. The analysis was conducted for the entire sample and also for each type of urinary incontinence. RESULTS: In total, 45 women presented with stress incontinence, 15 with mixed incontinence and 9 with incontinence associated with prolapse. The average cost per patient at one year post-operation was 1220 €. The QALY achieved at one year was 0.046. The results reveal an ICER at one year of 26,288 €/QALY, which is below the cost-effectiveness threshold considered acceptable, and this value was lower for stress incontinence (21,191 €/QALY). The cost-effectiveness was 106.5 €/International Consultation Incontinence Questionnaire Short-form unit. CONCLUSION: Surgery for female urinary incontinence using slings is cost-effective compared with abstention in our public health environment",10.1016/j.ejogrb.2013.08.035
11018,Health-related quality of life in family members of patients with an advanced cancer diagnosis: a one-year prospective study,"Aged; Chi-Square Distribution; Family/psychology; Family Health/statistics & numerical data; Female; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms/diagnosis/secondary; Humans; Linear Models; Lung Neoplasms/diagnosis/secondary; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Quality of Life; Self-Assessment; Social Class; Surveys and Questionnaires; Sweden","BACKGROUND: Receiving a cancer diagnosis affects family members as well as the person diagnosed. Family members often provide support for the sick person in daily life out of duty and love, and may not always think of their own vulnerability to illness. To individualise support for them, family members who are most at risk for becoming ill must be identified.The aim of this study was to investigate health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in family members of patients with advanced lung or gastrointestinal cancer 3 to 15 months after diagnosis METHODS: Data on mental and physical dimensions of HRQOL were collected from family members of these patients in this prospective quantitative study. Five assessments using the Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36) and EuroQol (EQ-5D) were conducted during a 1-year period starting 3 months after diagnosis Thirty-six family members completed the study, i.e. participated in all five data collections. RESULTS: No statistically significant changes in physical or mental HRQOL within the study group appeared over the 1-year follow-up. Compared with norm-based scores, family members had significantly poorer mental HRQOL scores throughout the year as measured by the SF-36. Family members also scored statistically significantly worse on the EQ-5D VAS in all five assessments compared to the norm-based score. Findings showed that older family members and partners were at higher risk for decreased physical HRQOL throughout the 1-year period, and younger family members were at higher risk for poorer mental HRQOL CONCLUSIONS: It is well known that ill health is associated with poor HRQOL. By identifying family members with poor HRQOL, those at risk of ill health can be identified and supported. Future large-scale research that verifies our findings is needed before making recommendations for individualised support and creating interventions best tailored to family members at risk for illness",10.1186/1477-7525-10-89

Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces not only the rate of revision due to infection but also the rate of revision due to aseptic loosening. This suggests under-diagnosis of infections in patients with presumed aseptic loosening and indicates that current diagnostic tools are suboptimal. In a previous multicenter study on 176 patients undergoing revision of a total hip arthroplasty due to presumed aseptic loosening, optimized diagnostics revealed that 4-13% of the patients had a low-grade infection. These infections were not treated as such, and in the current follow-up study the effect on mid- to long-term implant survival was investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients were sent a 2-part questionnaire. Part A requested information about possible re-revisions of their total hip arthroplasty. Part B consisted of 3 patient-related outcome measure questionnaires (EQ5D, Oxford hip score, and visual analog scale for pain). Additional information was retrieved from the medical records. The group of patients found to have a low-grade infection was compared to those with aseptic loosening. RESULTS: 173 of 176 patients from the original study were included. In the follow-up time between the revision surgery and the current study (mean 7.5 years), 31 patients had died. No statistically significant difference in the number of re-revisions was found between the infection group (2 out of 21) and the aseptic loosening group (13 out of 152); nor was there any significant difference in the time to re-revision. Quality of life, function, and pain were similar between the groups, but only 99 (57%) of the patients returned part B. INTERPRETATION: Under-diagnosis of low-grade infection in conjunction with presumed aseptic revision of total hip arthroplasty may not affect implant survival",10.3109/17453674.2015.1086942

It is unique from nociceptive pain and requires evaluation of the relevance and utility of common pain measures created for other painful conditions. This study evaluated the psychometric properties of a modified Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) for patients with painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (BPI-DPN). Participants were patients with painful DPN (n=255) enrolled in a DPN Burden of Illness survey referred through 17 outpatient settings (primary care physicians, endocrinologists, neurologists, and anesthesiologists). Patients completed the BPI-DPN, and self-report measures of health-related quality of life, mood sleep, and healthcare utilization Construct, criterion and discriminant validity, and internal consistency reliability were evaluated. Principal axis factoring with oblimin rotation revealed two interpretable factors (eigenvalues>1.0), consistent with most published BPI validation studies; a severity scale comprising the four BPI Severity items and an interference scale comprising the seven Interference items, which satisfied criteria for interpretability and model fit. Cronbach's alpha was high (0.94) for both scales. Mean pain Severity was highly correlated with Bodily Pain from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-12, version 2 (rs=0.63, P < 0.001), the Pain/Discomfort item in the Euro-QoL (rs=0.58, P < 0.001), and a verbal rating scale measure of pain severity (rs=0.74, P < 0.001). Individual BPI-DPN Interference domains were moderately correlated (rs's >0.5, P < 0.001) with analogous measures, and the Sleep Interference item had a high, significant association with the three primary Medical Outcome Study-Sleep scale subscales (rs's=0.66-71, P < 0.001). Worst Pain and Interference ratings were significantly associated with hospital utilization and outpatient visits due to DPN. These results replicate, in a pure peripheral neuropathic pain condition, the BPI psychometric characteristics documented in populations with nociceptive or mixed pain conditions. The BPI-DPN is a promising instrument in the evaluation of painful DPN",10.1016/j.jpainsymman.2004.06.018

METHODS: A stepped wedge design was used. Challenging behaviour and quality of life were measured using the Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI) and the QUALIDEM. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were calculated using the EuroQol-5D. Psychoactive medication use (range 0-5 per measurement) and sick leave were registered. Costs included medication, time spent on challenging behaviour and education. Costs and effects were analysed using linear multilevel regression. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated. Statistical uncertainty was estimated using bootstrapping. RESULTS: Seventeen dementia special care units participated. GRIP led to improvement on the QUALIDEM subscale social relations (1.6; 95% CI 0.18 to 3.4) and on the use of psychoactive medication (-0.73; 95% CI -1.1 to -0.46) and to a decrease in QALYs (-0.02; 95% CI -0.06 to -0.003). No significant effects on CMAI, sick leave and other QUALIDEM subscales were found. The intervention was not cost-effective in comparison with usual care with regard to CMAI score, QALYs and sick leave. The willingness to pay should be 320€/point improvement on the QUALIDEM subscale social relations and 370€/psychoactive medication less to reach a 0.95 probability of cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSION: It depends on how much society is willing to pay whether GRIP can be considered cost-effective. Because the appropriateness of the current methods for analysing cost-effectiveness in this specific population is uncertain, the positive effects on behaviour, medication and job satisfactions should also be taken in account in the decision making",10.1002/gps.4360
4287,Radiofrequency neurotomy in chronic lumbar and sacroiliac joint pain: A meta-analysis,Arthralgia/therapy; Chronic Pain/therapy; Conservative Treatment; Denervation; Humans; Low Back Pain/therapy; Sacroiliac Joint; Treatment Outcome,"BACKGROUND: Effective treatment of low back pain (LBP) originating in the lumbar and sacroiliac joints is difficult to achieve. The objective of the current study was to compare the clinical effectiveness of radiofrequency (RF) neurotomy versus conservative nonsurgical approaches for the management of chronic lumbar and sacroiliac joint pain. METHODS: The PICOS framework was adhered to (P [population]: patients with a history of chronic function-limiting lumbar and sacroiliac joint pain lasting at least 6 months; I [intervention]: RF neurotomy; C [comparator]: other nonsurgical treatments; O [outcomes]: the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), measurement for pain, and a quality of life (QoL) questionnaire; S [study design]: meta-analysis). Two trained investigators systematically searched Medline, Cochrane, EMBASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases for relevant studies published in English through March 2019. RESULTS: Patients treated with RF neurotomy (n = 528) had significantly greater improvement in ODI scores, pain scores and QoL measured by EQ-5D compared with controls (n = 457); however, significant heterogeneity was observed when data were pooled from eligible studies. In subgroup analyses, patients who received RF neurotomy had a significantly greater improvement in ODI scores compared with those with sham treatment. Patients treated with RF achieved significantly greater improvement in pain scores compared with controls who received sham treatment or medical treatment. In a subgroup analysis of pain in the sacroiliac joint and in lumbar facet joints, the RF neurotomy group achieved a significantly greater improvement in ODI score and pain scores compared with the control group The ODI score and pain score were improved after 2 months of follow up in the analyses stratified by follow-up duration. CONCLUSIONS: Use of RF neurotomy as an intervention for chronic lumbar and sacroiliac joint pain led to improved function; however, larger, more directly comparable studies are needed to confirm this study's findings",10.1097/MD.0000000000016230

Accurate health-related quality of life data is essential for quality-adjusted life year calculation; a key outcome in economic evaluation Thirteen child-parent dyads (13 children with mobility impairments, 13 parent proxies) were asked to complete a range of outcome measures (EQ-5D-Y, VAS and HUI2/3) relating to the child's health. The relationship between respondent outcomes was examined using tests of respondent type effect (Wilcoxon signed-rank), correlation (Spearman's rank-order) and agreement (Bland-Altman plots). RESULTS: Parent proxies significantly undervalued the health-related quality of life of their mobility-impaired children: children rated their health-related quality of life higher than their parents by proxy on all measures. The VAS had the highest overall mean score for children and proxies (79.50 [SD = 15.01] and 75.77 [SD = 14.70] respectively). Child and proxy results were significantly different (p < 0.05) for all measures besides the VAS (p = 0.138). Strong correlation and acceptable agreement were observed for equivalent child/proxy VAS and HUI measures. The EQ-5D-Y exhibited the least agreement between children and proxies. Sufficient association between child/proxy VAS and HUI measures indicated a degree of interchangeability",10.1186/s13104-017-2683-9

METHODS: The prospective study was conducted on a total of 41 patients with supraspinatus tendon tear combined with Lafosse I subscapularis injury Eighteen patients were divided into the repair group and 23 patients were divided into the non-repair group. The two groups were compared for intraoperative parameters, pain score, range of motion of the shoulder joint, shoulder joint function and quality of life (QoL) at pre-operation, 3 and 6 months postoperatively and the final follow-up visit. RESULTS: The width of supraspinatus tendon tear did not exceed 3 cm and did not retract beyond the glenoid in among patients. There was no statistical difference of preoperative data between two groups, including age, course of disease, positive Jobe test, positive Bear-hug test, positive Lift-off test, Patte stage, longitudinal tear and pain severity (P > 0.05). Compared to preoperative levels, the severity of pain, ASES scores and EQ-5D-3L scores were significantly lower at 3 and 6 months postoperatively and the final position (P < 0.05). However, there was no statistical difference in pain severity, ASES scores and EQ-5D-3L scores between repair group and non-repair group (P > 0.05). Similarly, compared to preoperative levels, the range of motion of shoulder joint was significantly improved after operation, including internal rotation, external rotation, forward flexion and elevation (P < 0.05). However, there was no statistical difference in range of motion of shoulder joint between repair group and non-repair group (P > 0.05) CONCLUSION: Operative treatment can effectively lessen severity of pain in the patients, improve shoulder joint function, increase the range of motion of the shoulder joint and enhance the QoL in treating anterosuperior rotator cuff injury. However, repair of subscapularis brings no benefit compared to debridement in treating supraspinatus tendon tear combined with Lafosse I subscapularis injury",10.1186/s12891-021-04805-5

METHODS: Repeated assessments were conducted in rehabilitation wards of a medical centre. A study cohort was recruited from inpatients (n = 478). A total of 342 participants (71.5%) completed 2 assessments; 1 at ward admission and 1 before hospital discharge Outcome measures, including the Barthel Index (BI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and EQ-5D, were administered at ward admission and before hospital discharge. RESULTS: The validity of the EQ-5D utility weights was assessed by comparison with the scores of the BI and PHQ-9. The absolute values of Pearson correlation coefficients ranged from 0.40 to 0.52 for the association of EQ-5D utility weights with BI scores and PHQ-9 scores at admission and before hospital discharge. The EQ-5D utility weights had a moderate effect size (0.76), moderate standardized response mean (0.74), and a significant difference (paired t-value = 13.7, p < 0.001) between baseline and follow-up in their ability to detect changes in the health status of stroke survivors staying in a rehabilitation ward. CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of the EQ-5D utility weights as a valid and responsive instrument for performing cost-utility analyses of stroke survivors, including those with higher levels of dependence, at the subacute stage",10.2340/16501977-2069

Sixty severe nonacute LBP patients (pain duration of at least 3 weeks, Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) ≥5) will be recruited at four Korean medicine hospitals. Participants will be randomly allocated to the Chuna group (n = 20), usual care group (n = 20), or Chuna plus usual care group (n = 20) for 6 weeks of treatment. Usual care will consist of orally administered conventional medicine, physical therapy, and back pain care education. The trial will be conducted with outcome assessor and statistician blinding. The primary endpoint will be NRS of LBP at week 7 post randomization Secondary outcomes include NRS of leg pain, the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), the Credibility and Expectancy Questionnaire, lumbar range of motion (ROM), the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) health survey, the Health Utility Index III (HUI-III), and economic evaluation and safety data. Post-treatment follow-ups will be conducted at 1, 4, and 10 weeks after conclusion of treatment. DISCUSSION: This study will assess the comparative effectiveness of Chuna manual therapy compared to conventional usual care. Costs and effectiveness (utility) data will be analyzed for exploratory cost-effectiveness analysis. If this pilot study does not reach a definite conclusion due to its small sample size, these results will be used as preliminary results to calculate sample size for future large-scale clinical trials and contribute in the assessment of feasibility of a full-scale multicenter trial.

Health state utility value (HSUV) is a recognized measure for health economic appraisals and is extensively used as an indicator for decision-making studies. This study is a systematic review of literature aimed to estimate mean utility value in COPD using meta-analysis and explore degree of heterogeneity in the utility values across a variety of clinical and study characteristic. The literature review covers studies that used EQ-5D to estimate utility value for patient level research in COPD. Studies that reported utility values elicited by EQ-5D in COPD patients were selected for random-effect meta-analysis addressing inter-study heterogeneity and subgroup analyses. Thirty-two studies were included in the general utility meta-analysis The estimated general utility value was 0.673 (95% CI 0.653 to 0.693) Meta-analyses of COPD stages utility values showed influence of airway obstruction on utility value. The utility values ranged from 0.820 (95% CI 0.767 to 0.872) for stage I to 0.624 (95% CI 0.571 to 0.677) for stage IV. There was substantial heterogeneity in utility values: I(2) = 97.7%. A more accurate measurement of utility values in COPD is needed to refine valid and generalizable scores of HSUV. Given the limited success of the factors studied to reduce heterogeneity, an approach needs to be developed how best to use mean utility values for COPD in health economic evaluation",10.3109/15412555.2015.1092953

A major mediator of AKI is the activation of leukocytes through exposure to the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit. We evaluate the use of leukodepletion filters throughout bypass to protect against post-operative AKI by removing activated leukocytes during cardiac surgery. METHODS: This is a single-centre, double-blind, randomized controlled trial comparing the use of leukodepletion versus a standard arterial filter throughout bypass. Elective adult patients undergoing heart valve surgery with or without concomitant procedures were investigated. The primary clinical outcome measured was the development of AKI according to the KDIGO criteria. Secondary measures included biomarkers of renal tubular damage (urinary Retinol Binding Protein and Kidney Injury Molecule-1), glomerular kidney injury (urinary Micro Albumin and serum Cystatin C) and urinary Neutrophil Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin, as well as the length of hospital stay and quality of life measures through EQ-5D-5L questionnaires. RESULTS: The ROLO trial randomized 64 participants with a rate of recruitment higher than anticipated (57% achieved, 40% anticipated). The incidence of AKI was greater in the leukodepletion filter group (44% versus 23%, risk difference 21, 95% CI - 2 to 44%). This clinical finding was supported by biomarker levels especially by a tendency toward glomerular insult at 48 h, demonstrated by a raised serum Cystatin C (mean difference 0.11, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.23, p = 0.068) in the leukodepleted group. There was however no clear association between the incidence or severity of AKI and length of hospital stay. On average, health related quality of life returned to pre-operative levels in both groups within 3 months of surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Leukocyte depletion during cardiopulmonary bypass does not significantly reduce the incidence of AKI after valvular heart surgery. Other methods to ameliorate renal dysfunction after cardiac surgery need to be investigated.

METHODS: HIV patients (n=120) on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in the infectious disease clinic of Hospital Sungai Buloh were randomized to either FDC (n=60) or FRC (n=60) Morisky scores, health-related quality of life scores and clinical outcomes such as CD4 count and viral load were assessed in both groups at baseline and six months. RESULT: Patients on FDC (108 SD=1.1) had a significantly higher CD4 count increase compared to the FRC group (746.1 SD=36.3 vs 799.8 SD=33.8) (p <0.001) The viral load profile was unchanged and remained undetectable in both groups The quality of life EQ-5D scores showed a positive correlation with CD4 counts in the FDC group (ρ=0.301, p=0.019) at six months. On the other hand, quality of life EQ-VAS scores was significantly associated with medication adherence in the FDC group at six months (ρ=0.749, p=0.05). However, no significant changes or associations were observed in the FRC group. CONCLUSION: Management of HAART using an FDC demonstrated a positive clinical outcome, adherence and quality of life within six months in local HIV patients",10.18549/PharmPract.2016.04.830

Various open-ended and structured questionnaires focusing on diagnostic aspects of symptoms and impairment caused by the disease were used For activity limitation and participation restriction, standardized questionnaires were used. Open-ended questions on impact of the disease were asked, and subsequently classified based on the WHO-ICF classification. The general HRQoL was evaluated with EQ-5D index value and EQ VAS instruments Correlation and linear regression analyses were used to explore the association between HRQoL and other aspects. Based on the explanatory power of different models the disease specific semeionic model provides the most accurate prediction in EQ-5D index calculations (38 % of the variance explained). In EQ VAS scores, HRQoL is most accurately determined by participation restriction (53 % of the variance explained), but the worst prediction was in ICF-based limitations (8 % of the variance explained). Interestingly, attitude and personal trait explained the reduction of HRQoL somewhat better than ICF-based variables. Activity limitation and participation restrictions are significant components of MD, but are less frequently recognized as significant factors in self-evaluating the effect of MD on the quality of life. The current study results suggest that MD patients seem to have problem identifying factors causing activity limitation and participation restrictions and hence use the semiotic description focusing on complaints",10.1186/s40064-015-1527-0

METHODS: Patients participating in the Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease:Preterax and Diamicron MR Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE) trial were administered a health-related quality-of-life questionnaire, the three-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-3L), on four occasions over a 5-year period. We used two-way fixed-effects longitudinal regression models to investigate the impact of incident diabetes complications (stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, renal failure, blindness, and amputation) on EQ-5D-3L utility score (where 1 = perfect health), while controlling for characteristics of individuals that do not vary over time RESULTS: The effect of having any one of the seven complications was to reduce the EQ-5D-3L utility score by 0.054 (95% confidence interval 0.044-0.064), and this was not significantly affected by baseline age, sex, economic region, or the value set used to derive utilities. The complication with the largest disutility was amputation (0.122), followed by stroke (0.099), blindness (0.083), renal failure (0.049), heart failure (0.045), and myocardial infarction (0.026) Ischemic heart disease did not significantly reduce the utility score. Quality of life also declined with elapsed time-by an average of 0.006 per year, in addition to the effect of complications. CONCLUSIONS: Common complications significantly reduce health-related quality of life. Utility scores derived from the EQ-5D-3L provide a potential measure that can be used to summarize patient-reported outcomes and inform health economic models. Prevention of complications is critical to reduce the progressive burden of declining quality of life for people with diabetes",10.1016/j.jval.2015.10.010

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the health utilities of people with HIV/AIDS in Bogotá, Columbia METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted for 181 patients receiving antiretroviral therapy from an outpatient HIV/AIDS clinic in Bogotá. The five-level version of the EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) and the EuroQol visual analogue scale (EQ-VAS) were used to estimate HRQOL scores. To derive utilities on the basis of the EQ-5D-5L, the Spanish value set was used Subgroup analyses were performed according to sex, age, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classification, and CD4 cell count. RESULTS: The mean utility of the EQ-5D-5L was estimated at 0.85 ± 0.21 and the EQ-VAS score was estimated at 84 ± 14. Pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression were the two EQ-5D-5L dimensions associated with the poorer outcomes. Subgroup analyses revealed significantly higher utilities (using the EQ-5D-5L) for men than for women (0.88 vs. 0.76; P = 0.002) and lower utilities for patients with severe HIV (0.83 for CD4 < 200 vs. 0.87 for CD4 ≥ 500; P = 0.024). CONCLUSIONS: The HRQOL scores of patients with HIV/AIDS receiving antiretroviral therapy were relatively high in Bogotá, Colombia, using the EuroQol questionnaire. The utility data could be useful, in combination with cost data, for future economic evaluations",10.1016/j.vhri.2016.05.001

METHODS: In an eight centre, UK wide, cross-sectional study we approached patients during their routine follow-up to complete: a disease-specific instrument (European Brain Injury Questionnaire, Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale, and Parkinson's disease questionnaire); General Health questionnaire with a Quality of life measure (EQ-5D); and PRO. We validated the PRO using factor analysis to define the latent construct domains, then calculated the internal consistency (Cronbach's-α), and construct validity (correlation). RESULTS: There were 340 patients with ABI (N = 91, median age = 55.1, 41% female), MS (N = 99, age = 58.9, 69%) and PD (N = 150, age = 74.5, 40%). Factor analysis suggested the PRO offered three domains of: physical health; functionality-capacity and mental health. All factors correlated strongly with the three disease-specific instruments, and the overall PRO had a large correlation with the EQ-5D (correlation>0.8) offering good construct validity and excellent internal consistency (∝>0.89). INTERPRETATION: The PRO offered promising psychometric properties and could be used in place of disease specific questionnaires for patients with ABI, MS, and PD. The PRO has three construct domains, describing patients': mental health; physical health; and functional-capacity, and may be used in routine clinical practice. The PRO offered both relevance to each of the three separate neurological conditions and generalisability across all the conditions, increasing its utility",10.1371/journal.pone.0251484

Pregnant women exposed to first-hand smoke and second-hand smoke are susceptible to physiological and psychological health issues has been proved in previous studies. Nevertheless, there are no enough studies focus on the impact of third-hand smoke during pregnancy. This study aimed to assess and compare health-related quality of life for pregnant women with exposure to first-hand smoke, second-hand smoke, third-hand smoke and non-exposure to tobacco in mainland China. METHODS: National-based cross-sectional study is based on a questionnaire survey which collects information including demographics, smoking behaviors and self-evaluation. All questionnaires were delivered and collected from August to September 2019. EuroQol group's visual analog scale and EuroQoL Five-dimension Questionnaire were used to collect data in mainland China. RESULTS: Totally, 15,682 pregnant women were included in this study, among which non-exposure to smoke were 7564 (48.2%), exposed to first-hand smoke, second-hand smoke and third-hand smoke were 89 (0.6%), 2349 (15.0%), and 5680 (36.2%) respectively Pregnant women without tobacco exposure had the highest EuroQol group's visual analog scale score (mean value = 85.4[SD = 14.0]), while those with first-hand smoke had the lowest score (mean value = 77.4[SD = 22.2]). Among all five dimensions of EuroQoL Five-dimension Questionnaire, there were significant differences of EQ-index among groups with different tobacco exposure in usual activity and anxiety or depression dimensions (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Third-hand smoke exposure had close relationship with low health-related quality of life in pregnant women. Moreover, second-hand smoke exposure significantly led more problems on mental dimension of pregnant women",10.1186/s12955-021-01785-x

Longitudinal data on 1781 individuals from an Estonian rapid-assessment survey on COVID-19 were used. HRQoL was assessed with the EQ-5D-3L in June 2020 (baseline) and in May 2021 (follow-up) The HRQoL index score and its socio-demographic and behavioural variations were analysed using paired t-tests and Tobit regression modelling. Statistically significant declines in mean EQ-5D index scores were observed for all socio-demographic and behavioural variables considered. Most of these changes were due to increased reporting of problems in the pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression health domains. Older age, being unemployed or economically non-active and having financial difficulties were significantly associated with lower HRQoL in both baseline and follow-up measurements. In the follow-up data, women had significantly lower HRQoL compared to men, whereas higher education proved to be the only protective factor regarding HRQoL. Unhealthy dietary habits and low physical activity had a negative impact on the HRQoL score in the follow-up data. These results indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on HRQoL in the Estonian population",10.3390/ijerph19159060
2628,Comparison of the Outcomes of Microendoscopic Discectomy Versus Full-Endoscopic Discectomy for the Treatment of L4/5 Lumbar Disc Herniation,L4/5; full-endoscopic discectomy; lumbar disc herniation; microendoscopic discectomy; minimally invasive,"STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective Comparative Study. OBJECTIVES: To compare the outcomes of microendoscopic discectomy (MED) versus full-endoscopic discectomy (FED) for treating L4/5 lumbar disc herniation (LDH). METHODS: A retrospective study was performed on patients with L4/5 LDH treated using MED (n = 249) or FED (n = 124). A 16-mm tubular retractor and endoscope was used for MED, while a 4.1-mm working channel endoscope was used for FED. Patient background and operative data were collected. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) scores were recorded preoperatively and at 1 and 2 years postsurgery. RESULTS: The background data of the two groups were similar. The mean operation times for MED and FED were 59.3 and 47.7 min (respectively), and the mean volumes of removed nucleus pulposus were .65 and 1.03 g, respectively. These differences were significant (P < .001). Six dural tears and one postoperative hematoma were observed in the MED group; none were observed in the FED group. During the follow-up period, 16 MED and 7 FED patients required re-operation due to recurrence (P = 1.00). Although the ODI and EQ-5D scores significantly improved at 1 and 2 years postsurgery in both groups, the differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Operative outcomes were almost identical in both groups. We did not observe any operative or postoperative complications in FED. We, therefore, recommend FED as the first option for the treatment of L4/5 LDH since it has a better safety profile and is minimally invasive",10.1177/21925682221127997
6222,Effects of Roflumilast on Rehospitalization and Mortality in Patients,COPD hospitalization; exacerbations; roflumilast,"Introduction: Hospitalization for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation portends the greatest risk of rehospitalization and mortality Treatments that prevent hospitalizations could significantly lessen COPD morbidity and mortality. Methods: We performed a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of roflumilast 500 ug daily versus placebo in patients hospitalized for acute COPD exacerbation. Primary outcome was time to all-cause mortality or non-elective rehospitalization at 180 days post-randomization. Secondary outcomes were death or hospitalization from a respiratory cause, quality of life, change in health status, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) and roflumilast tolerance. Results: A total of 64 patients with moderate to severe COPD (FEV(1), 37.6 ± 16.4% predicted; 61% female, 61.6 ± 7.9 years old) were assigned to roflumilast or placebo. No deaths occurred in the follow-up period. There was no difference in the time to first readmission between the roflumilast and placebo groups (46.1 days versus 47.3 days respectively, p=0.93). There were 29 and 30 readmissions in the roflumilast and placebo groups, respectively (p=0.47). The St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) decreased 10.8 points and 7.8 points in the roflumilast and placebo groups, respectively and were not different. EuroQuality of Life Five Dimension scale (EQ5D) scores improved, but not significantly in either group Weight loss and nausea were more common with roflumilast but not different from placebo. Change in glycosylated hemoglobin percentage (HgbA1C%) was not different between groups. Sub-analysis for the impact of chronic bronchitis did not affect outcomes. Conclusion: In this pilot study conducted in patients hospitalized with an exacerbation of COPD, roflumilast did not affect time to all-cause rehospitalization, quality of life, FEV(1) or any other measured parameter",10.15326/jcopdf.6.1.2018.0139

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is a treatment that when given to patients in respiratory failure leads to improved survival and quality of life. Diaphragm pacing (DP), using the NeuRx/4(®) diaphragm pacing system (DPS)™ (Synapse Biomedical, Oberlin, OH, USA), is a new technique that may offer additional or alternative benefits to patients with ALS who are in respiratory failure OBJECTIVE: The Diaphragm Pacing in patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (DiPALS) trial evaluated the effect of DP on survival over the study duration in patients with ALS with respiratory failure. DESIGN: The DiPALS trial was a multicentre, parallel-group, open-label, randomised controlled trial incorporating health economic analyses and a qualitative longitudinal substudy PARTICIPANTS: Eligible participants had a diagnosis of ALS (ALS laboratory-supported probable, clinically probable or clinically definite according to the World Federation of Neurology revised El Escorial criteria), had been stabilised on riluzole for 30 days, were aged ≥ 18 years and were in respiratory failure. We planned to recruit 108 patients from seven UK-based specialist ALS or respiratory centres. Allocation was performed using 1 : 1 non-deterministic minimisation. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomised to either standard care (NIV alone) or standard care (NIV) plus DP using the NeuRX/4 DPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was overall survival, defined as the time from randomisation to death from any cause. Secondary outcomes were patient quality of life [assessed by European Quality of Life-5 Dimensions, three levels (EQ-5D-3L), Short Form questionnaire-36 items and Sleep Apnoea Quality of Life Index questionnaire]; carer quality of life (EQ-5D-3L and Caregiver Burden Inventory); cost-utility analysis and health-care resource use; tolerability and adverse events. Acceptability and attitudes to DP were assessed in a qualitative substudy. RESULTS: In total, 74 participants were randomised into the trial and analysed, 37 participants to NIV plus pacing and 37 to standard care, before the Data Monitoring and Ethics Committee advised initial suspension of recruitment (December 2013) and subsequent discontinuation of pacing (on safety grounds) in all patients (June 2014). Follow-up assessments continued until the planned end of the study in December 2014. The median survival (interquartile range) was 22.5 months (lower quartile 11.8 months; upper quartile not reached) in the NIV arm and 11.0 months (6.7 to 17.0 months) in the NIV plus pacing arm, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 2.27 (95% confidence interval 1.22 to 4.25; p = 0.01) CONCLUSIONS: Diaphragmatic pacing should not be used as a routine treatment for patients with ALS in respiratory failure. FUTURE WORK: It may be that certain population subgroups benefit from DP. We are unable to explain the mechanism behind the excess mortality in the pacing arm, something the small trial size cannot help address. Future research should investigate the mechanism by which harm or benefit occurs further. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN53817913.

METHODS: We conducted the QOL-MAC study where EQ-5D-5L, EORTC QLQ-C30, and FACT-G were cross-sectionally evaluated in patients receiving drug treatment for solid tumors in Japan. We developed direct and indirect mapping algorithms using 7 regression methods Direct mapping was based on the Japanese value set. We evaluated the predictive performances based on root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error, and correlation between the observed and predicted EQ-5D-5L indexes. RESULTS: Based on data from 903 and 908 patients for EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-G, respectively, we recommend two-part beta regression for direct mapping and ordinal logistic regression for indirect mapping for both EORTC QLQ-C30 and FACT-G Cross-validated RMSE were 0.101 in the two methods for EORTC QLQ-C30, whereas they were 0.121 in two-part beta regression and 0.120 in ordinal logistic regression for FACT-G. The mean EQ-5D-5L index and cumulative distribution function simulated from the recommended mapping algorithms generally matched with the observed ones except for very good health (both source measures) and poor health (only FACT-G). CONCLUSIONS: The developed mapping algorithms can be used to generate the EQ-5D-5L index from EORTC QLQ-C30 or FACT-G in cost-effectiveness analyses, whose predictive performance would be similar to or better than those of previous algorithms",10.1186/s12955-020-01611-w

The aim of this study was to evaluate short and long-term mortality and quality of life (QoL) of elderly patients (80 years and older) admitted to two ICUs for medical conditions, abdominal surgery (planned and unplanned) and orthopedic surgery for hip fractures, over a 6-year period Three months and one year after ICU discharge, patients or family members were contacted by telephone to obtain follow-up information using the EuroQoL questionnaire. The data were compared with an age-matched of the Italian population. Two hundred eighty-eight patients were included in the study. ICU mortality of medical (14.8%) and unplanned surgical patients (26.4%) was higher than that of planned surgical (5.0%) and orthopedic patients (2.5%), as was hospital mortality (27.7% vs. 50.0% vs. 5.0% vs. 14.3%). Three months and 12 months mortality rates after ICU discharge were 40.7% and 61.1% in medical patients, 70.5% and 76.4% in unplanned surgical patients, 20.0% and 30.0% in planned surgical patients, 36.2% and 46.2% in orthopedic patients. QoL measures revealed that, one year after ICU discharge, medical and orthopedic patients had significantly more severe problems vis-à-vis mobility, self-care and activity than abdominal surgical patients and control population. Type of admission was the independent risk factor associated with ICU and long-term mortality, whereas age 90 year and older was associated with long-term mortality. Orthopedic surgery for hip fractures seems to influence QoL similar to medical diseases",10.1016/j.archger.2011.11.013
9526,A platform in the use of medicines to treat chronic hepatitis C (PLATINUM C): protocol for a prospective treatment registry of real-world outcomes for hepatitis C,"Antiviral Agents/therapeutic use; Australia/epidemiology; Genotype; Hepacivirus/genetics; Hepatitis C, Chronic/drug therapy/epidemiology/virology; Humans; Life Style; Liver Cirrhosis/diagnosis; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Prospective Studies; RNA, Viral/blood/genetics; Registries; Sustained Virologic Response; Direct-acting antiviral treatment; Hepatitis C; Platform trial; Treatment registry","BACKGROUND: Safe, highly curative, short course, direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapies are now available to treat chronic hepatitis C. DAA therapy is freely available to all adults chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Australia. If left untreated, hepatitis C may lead to progressive hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Australia is committed to eliminating hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030 set by the World Health Organization. However, since the introduction of funded DAA treatment, uptake has been suboptimal. Australia needs improved strategies for testing, treatment uptake and treatment completion to address the persisting hepatitis C public health problem. PLATINUM C is a HCV treatment registry and research platform for assessing the comparative effectiveness of alternative interventions for achieving virological cure. METHODS: PLATINUM C will prospectively enrol people with active HCV infection confirmed by recent detection of HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) in blood. Those enrolled will agree to allow standardised collection of demographic, lifestyle, treatment, virological outcome and other relevant clinical data to better inform the future management of HCV infection. The primary outcome is virological cure evidenced by sustained virological response (SVR), which is defined as a negative HCV PCR result 6 to 18 months after initial prescription of DAA therapy and no less than 12 weeks after the completion of treatment. Study participants will be invited to opt-in to medication adherence monitoring and quality of life assessments using validated self-reported instruments (EQ-5D-5L). DISCUSSION: PLATINUM C is a treatment registry and platform for nesting pragmatic trials. Data collected will inform the design, development and implementation of pragmatic trials. The digital infrastructure, study procedures and governing systems established by the registry will allow PLATINUM C to support a wider research platform in the management of hepatitis C in primary care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered with the Australia and New Zealand Clinical Trials Register ( ACTRN12619000023156 ). Date of registration: 10/01/2019",10.1186/s12879-020-05531-4

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to analyze the acute and long-term effects of ICD shock on objective behavioral data (ie, device-based physical activity) and subjective patient-reported outcomes (eg, quality of life and shock anxiety). METHODS: The PainFree Smart Shock Technology (SST) clinical trial included 2770 patients with a single- or dual-chamber ICD or cardiac resynchronization therapy - defibrillator device who were followed for 22 ± 9 months. Participants completed measures of quality of life (EuroQol-5D [EQ-5D] questionnaire) and shock anxiety (Florida Shock Anxiety Scale) at baseline, biannual visits, and monthly for 6 months after an ICD shock. Daily physical activity data were obtained from a built-in device accelerometer. RESULTS: The average daily activity was 185.3 ± 119.4 min/d. Activity was significantly reduced after an ICD shock (P < .0001) and recovered to a normal level after ∼90 days. An ICD shock was also associated with decreased quality of life (EQ5-D health score) and increased EQ-5D anxiety scores, but it did not affect mobility, self-care, activity, or pain. Similarly, shock anxiety (Florida Shock Anxiety Scale) increased in shocked patients and remained significantly elevated at 24 months, regardless of appropriate or inappropriate shock delivery. CONCLUSION: ICD shocks have a long-lasting adverse effect on both objective, device-measured physical activity and subjective patient-reported outcomes of quality of life and shock anxiety. Successful management of patients with an ICD requires attention to clinically relevant behavioral and psychological outcomes to expedite recovery and return to activities of daily living",10.1016/j.hrthm.2017.12.026

However, the proven validity of more robust and cumbersome patient-reported outcomes instruments (PROis) must be balanced with what is feasible to apply in large-scale registry efforts. PURPOSE: To determine the relative validity and responsiveness of common PROis in accurately determining effectiveness of lumbar fusion for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis in registry efforts. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: Fifty-eight patients undergoing transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) for degenerative lumbar spondylolisthesis OUTCOME MEASURES: Patient-reported outcome measures for pain (numeric rating scale for back and leg pain [NRS-BP, NRS-LP]), disability (Oswestry Disability Index [ODI]), general health (Short Form [SF]-12), quality of life (QOL) (EuroQol five dimensions [EQ-5D]), and depression (Zung depression scale [ZDS]) were assessed METHODS: Fifty-eight patients undergoing primary TLIF for lumbar spondylolisthesis were entered into an institutional registry and prospectively followed for 2 years. Baseline and 2-year patient-reported outcomes were assessed. To assess the validity of PROis to discriminate between effective and noneffective improvements, receiver operating characteristic curves were generated for each outcomes instrument. An area under the curve (AUC) of ≥0.80 was considered an accurate discriminator. The difference between standardized response means (SRMs) in patients reporting meaningful improvement versus not was calculated to determine the relative responsiveness of each instrument. RESULTS: For pain and disability, ODI had AUC=0.94, suggesting it as an accurate discriminator of meaningful improvement. Oswestry Disability Index was most responsive to postoperative improvement (SRM difference: 2.18), followed by NRS-BP and NRS-LP. For general health and QOL, SF-12 physical component score (AUC: 0.90), ZDS (AUC: 0.89), and SF-12 mental component score (AUC: 0.85) were all accurate discriminators of meaningful improvement, however, EQ-5D was most accurate (AUC: 0.97). EuroQol five dimensions was also most responsive (SRM difference: 2.83). CONCLUSIONS: For pain and disability, ODI was the most valid and responsive measure of effectiveness of lumbar fusion. Numeric rating scale-BP and NRS-LP should not be used as substitutes for ODI in measuring effectiveness of care in registry efforts. For health-related QOL, EQ-5D was the most valid and responsive measure of improvement, however, SF-12 and ZDS are valid alternatives with less responsiveness",10.1016/j.spinee.2014.04.023

The aim of the present study was to assess self-reported health status and HRQL, as well as patients' own valuation of their present health state in a sample of patients with different levels of severity of ALS. METHODS: Structured interviews were conducted with 77 patients with different levels of disease severity. Patients completed a disease-specific health status measure (ALSAQ-40), a generic health status measure (EuroQol EQ-5D), visual analogue scale (VAS) rating of current health and a standard gamble (SG) exercise to provide health state utilities for their own health state. RESULTS: The results from the ALSAQ-40 and EQ-5D descriptive system indicate that patients' HRQL decreases systematically with increasing severity of disease. Patients' mean VAS rating of their own health ranged from 0.74 for stage 1 (early) disease severity, to 0.37 for stage 4 (late stage) disease severity Utilities elicited via SG were systematically higher than VAS scores and ranged from a mean of 0.79 for stage 1 disease severity to a mean of 0.45 for stage 4 disease severity",10.1016/s0022-510x(01)00616-5

Nationwide data from the 5th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES V, 2010 to 2012) were used. MAFLD was defined by a fatty liver index (FLI) of ≥60, and the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) was used to assess HRQoL. Logistic regression analysis and odds ratios (ORs) were used to determine the associations of MAFLD with stress, mental health, and HRQoL. Previous suicidal impulse was not found to be significantly associated with HRQoL. The risk of MAFLD increased 1.265-fold with an increase in stress levels based on the stress perception rate (confidence index (CI): 1.046-1.530; p < 0.05), while it increased 1.091-fold with a 1-point decrease in the EQ-5D score (CI: 1.019-1.169; p < 0.05). HRQoL impairment and stress levels are associated with MAFLD. It is important to evaluate stress levels among MAFLD patients and implement stress management and HRQoL improvement strategies",10.3390/ijerph182413145

METHODS: A comprehensive literature review identified relevant studies, from which data were meta-analyzed over 3-month intervals up to 24 months. Patient-centered outcomes of interest included mean (95% CI) changes from baseline (Δ) in quality of life (QoL), measured using PD-specific (PDQ-8, PDQ-39) and generic (EQ-5D) instruments; activities of daily living (ADL), measured in On and Off states using UPDRS Part II; and motor symptoms (i.e., Off time/day and motor examination [measured in On and Off states using UPDRS Part III]). RESULTS: The pooled meta-analysis included data from 26 studies evaluating 1556 patients on CLES. At 3 months, all outcomes showed significant improvement: QoL (ΔPDQ-39 = -10.26 [-11.54, -8.97], ΔEQ-5D(VAS) = 15.42 [12.58, 18.26]); ADL (ΔUPDRS II(ON) = -4.32 [-5.63, -3.01]); motor symptoms (ΔOff time hours/day = -3.48 [-4.15, -2.82], ΔUPDRS III(ON) = -6.20 [-9.88, -2.51]). At 24 months, there were statistically significant mean improvements in QoL (ΔPDQ-39 = -7.74 [-12.40, -3.07], ΔEQ-5D(VAS) = 11.18 [6.90, 15.45]) and ADL (ΔUPDRS II(OFF) = -3.88 [-5.34, -2.42]), and Off time (-4.21 [-5.16, -3.26] hours/day). CONCLUSIONS: Impact of CLES on significantly reducing Off time/day was observed to be rapid and durable (i.e., remained consistent across 24 months). Most QoL and ADL measures showed a consistent pattern of improvement with initiation of treatment and remained significantly improved from baseline at 24 months",10.1016/j.parkreldis.2021.03.009
2131,Health-related quality of life and mental well-being of healthy and diseased persons in 8 countries: Does stringency of government response against early COVID-19 matter?,COVID-19; EQ-5D-5L; HRQoL; Stringency index; WHO-5; Well-being,"OBJECTIVES: Our study aimed to (1) assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and mental well-being of healthy and diseased persons in the general population during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) examine the relationship between HRQoL and mental well-being and individual characteristics and government response against COVID-19, as measured by the stringency index. METHODS: A web-based survey was administered to a cohort of persons from the general population of eight countries: Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (US) from April 22 to May 5 and May 26 to June 1, 2020. Country-level stringency indices were adopted from the COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. Primary outcomes were HRQoL, measured using the EQ-5D-5L, and mental well-being, measured using the World Health Organization-5 Well-Being (WHO-5). FINDINGS: 21,354 respondents were included in the study. Diseased respondents had lower EQ-5D-5L and WHO-5 scores compared to healthy respondents. Younger respondents had lower WHO-5 scores than older respondents. The stringency index had a stronger association with the EQ-5D-5L and WHO-5 among diseased respondents compared to healthy respondents. Increasing stringency was associated with an increase in EQ-5D-5L scores but a decrease in the WHO-5 index. CONCLUSION: The stringency of government response is inversely related to HRQoL and mental well-being with a small positive relation with HRQoL and strong negative relation with mental well-being. The magnitude of effects differed for healthy and diseased persons and by age but was most favourable for diseased and older persons",10.1016/j.ssmph.2021.100913
10473,Mapping the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) to EQ-5D utility scores,"Algorithms; Diabetic Retinopathy/physiopathology; Female; Health Status; Humans; Macular Edema/physiopathology; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; National Eye Institute (U.S.); Quality of Life/psychology; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sickness Impact Profile; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States; Visual Acuity/physiology","PURPOSE: To develop a mapping algorithm for the estimation of EQ-5D-based utility scores from observed 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25) scores, a disease-specific, patient-reported outcome measure used in several retinal disorders to evaluate vision-specific functioning. METHODS: The dataset comprised 951 paired EQ-5D/NEI VFQ-25 observations from 344 patients in RESTORE, a 12-month, randomized, double-blind trial in individuals with visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema. EQ-5D index scores (utilities) were calculated based on the UK tariff. We evaluated 11 models using predictor sets based on the NEI VFQ-25 subscales to estimate utility as a function of NEI VFQ-25 score, based on four modeling techniques. Model performance was assessed by 10-fold cross-validation comparing root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and correlation with EQ-5D score (Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients). RESULTS: Mapping results were similar across all techniques and predictor sets. The reverse two-part generalized estimating equation model used fewest predictors and had the best predictive performance (RMSE 0.200, MAE 0.140). Predicted and original EQ-5D values were not strongly correlated (squared Spearman correlation coefficient, 0.34) CONCLUSIONS: Although mapping disease-specific instruments to EQ-5D utilities is a preferred method by some reimbursement bodies, finding an appropriate mapping equation is not straightforward. In this study, mapping NEI VFQ-25 scores to EQ-5D utilities provided low predictive power, independent of the modeling methodology applied, suggesting an inability of the EQ-5D to discriminate vision-related activities, and highlighting that mapping exercises may lead to inaccurate utility values that do not represent patients' preferences",10.3109/09286586.2014.888456

The aim of the present study was to validate the FLQA-VS-10 in a prospective study. METHODS: We recruited 100 patients with recurrent varicosis or incomplete or complete venous insufficiency undergoing interventional vein treatment (high ligation of the great or small saphenous vein or endovenous ablation therapy). These patients completed the FLQA-VS-10 and instruments assessing convergent validation criteria at four points: preoperatively (T1), postoperatively (T2) and twice 3 years later with a 1-week interval (T3 and T4). RESULTS: The mean age was 56.0 ± 13.7 years, and 66.0% were women. The patients had presented with recurrent varicosis of the saphenofemoral junction (28.0%), recurrent varicosis of the saphenopopliteal junction (1.0%), incomplete or complete insufficiency of the great saphenous vein (69.0%), or complete insufficiency of the small saphenous vein (2.0%). The items showed few missing values. The FLQA-VS-10 global score showed no ceiling effect (patients reporting the highest possible impairments in HRQoL) but did show a floor effect (patients reporting the lowest possible impairments in HRQoL), which was highest at the postoperative assessments. The internal consistency of the global score was high at all measurement points. A convergent validity and responsiveness analysis revealed that the FLQA-VS-10 correlated in the expected direction with the convergent instruments, including the Freiburg Life Quality Assessment for venous diseases (venous disease-specific HRQoL) and the five-level EQ-5D (generic HRQoL). Data from T3 and T4 revealed high test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation, 0.92). Overall, the patients stated that the FLQA-VS-10 was comprehensible, comprehensive, and easy to complete. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the FLQA-VS-10 is a reliable, valid, responsive, and feasible HRQoL questionnaire for patients with chronic venous diseases. This questionnaire can serve as short and easy-to-use instrument to assess patient-reported outcomes in the treatment of these patients",10.1016/j.jvsv.2021.09.002

UCREX study aimed to identify CU patients' profile, disease management and quality-of-life (QoL) in daily clinical practice in Spain METHODS: Observational, 12-months prospective, multicenter study, included de novo or established CU patients attending to dermatology/allergy consultations in 39 Spanish hospitals. MAIN VARIABLES: Urticaria Activity Score (UAS), UAS over 7 days (UAS7). Secondary variables: CU-QoL Questionnaire (CU-Q(2)oL), EuroQol-5 dimensions (EQ-5D), Medical Outcomes Study Sleep (MOS-Sleep) scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS: 361 patients included. Of them, 176 (48.8%) considered for the main objective analysis. Mean age (SD) of 46.6 (14.2) years and 71.8% women. The year prior to inclusion, most patients (57.1%) were treated with non-sedating H1-antihistamines (NS-H1AH). At baseline, mean (SD) 3.6 (6.8) visits were registered to primary care. Mean (SD) UAS7 at baseline was 14.3 (11.0) and CU-Q(2)oL 24.1 (17.0) which tended to improve by 8.6 (9.7) and 13.9 (15.0), respectively, at 12-months. MOS-Sleep and EQ-5D remained steady during the study, except pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression which went from 58.7% and 49.6% to 29.6% and 26.9%, respectively. At baseline, HADS showed a mean (SD) anxiety of 8.7 (4.5) and depression 5.1 (4.4), decreasing to 7.0 (4.3) and 4.7 (4.3), respectively, at 12-months. CONCLUSIONS: Although most CU patients are treated with NS-H1AH, disease activity is still important, negatively affecting patients' QoL, work activity and healthcare resources use. An appropriate disease management could be the basis for symptoms control, QoL improvement and resources optimization",10.1016/j.ad.2021.06.014

In addition to symptomatic therapy, DBS has been increasingly recognized as a potential therapeutic strategy, especially in severe cases. Therefore, we wanted to report our experience regarding benefits of DBS in five PKAN cases in 3-year follow-up study. METHODS: Five genetically confirmed PKAN patients from Serbia underwent GPi-DBS. To assess clinical outcome, we reviewed medical charts and applied: Schwab and England Activities of Daily Living Scale (S&E), EQ-5D questionnaire for quality of life, Patient Global Impression of Improvement (GPI-I), Functional Independence Measure (FIM), Burke-Fahn-Marsden Dystonia Rating Scale (BFMDRS), Barry Albright Dystonia Scale (BAD). Patients were evaluated in five visits: at the disease onset, 5 years after the onset, before surgery, 6 months and 14-36 months after the surgery. Improvement of 20% was accepted as significant RESULTS: Overall, dystonia significantly improved after GPi-DBS at 6 and 14-36 months postoperatively, when assessed by the BFMDRS and BAD. However, two patients failed to improve considerably. Four patients reported improvement on GPI-I, while one remained unchanged. Three patients reported significant improvement, when assessed with S&E and FIM. EQ-5D showed the most prominent improvement in the domains of mobility and pain/discomfort. CONCLUSION: Three out of our five patients experienced beneficial effects of the GPi-DBS, in up to 36 months follow-up. Two patients who had not reached significant improvement had longer disease duration; therefore, it might be reasonable to recommend GPi-DBS as soon as dystonia became disabling",10.1007/s00415-019-09499-3

SETTING: The study population was drawn from the general public of Oxfordshire, England. METHODS: Participants were recruited from either general practices or the casualty department of the Oxford Eye Hospital (OEH). All persons who were between 16 and 80 years of age and English speaking were eligible for enrollment in the study. The inclusion criteria for cases was that participants: 1) experienced itchy, bloodshot and watering eyes at some time between February and August every year since 1999, and 2) considered it likely that this was in response to seasonal allergens. Controls were drawn from the same sources and were age- and sex-matched to cases. Participants completed the EQ-5D Health Questionnaire, the Rhinoconjunctivitis Quality of Life Questionnaire (RQLQ), the National Eye Institute (U.S.) Visual Functioning Questionnaire 25 (VFQ-25), and a specially developed Health Economic and Demographic Questionnaire. RESULTS: Most participants in both groups were female (67.5% in the SAC and 70% in the control group, P=0.565). Weekly earnings were lower in the SAC group (P<0.001), as the SAC group also worked fewer hours per week (P<0.001) Participants with SAC also experienced a greater degree of pain and discomfort as measured by the EQ-5D (P=0.018) and a lower perception of health using the EQ-VAS (P=0.039). Statistically significant differences between both groups were detected in all domains of the VFQ-25, except general and colour vision, although the differences were thought to be clinically significant only for the ocular pain domain. The RQLQ scores were also all found to differ significantly between groups (P<0.001). The total of both the public health care and private out-of-pocket costs of SAC in our study population ranged on average between pound sterling 64.61 for a pensioner to pound sterling 123.69 for a person with SAC in paid employment. CONCLUSIONS: SAC is a costly, highly prevalent, chronic condition associated with significant reductions in both ocular and general quality of life, as well as ongoing out-of-pocket expenses and health care costs Medications that reduce this demand on health care systems and out-of-pocket expenses by patients could be of potential importance in reducing the overall economic and health burden of illness posed by SAC",10.1076/opep.11.1.17.26437

AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the administration of analgesics and anxiolytics to people living in nursing homes, taking into account cognitive status. METHODS: For this cross-sectional study, we used data from 404 residents who lived in nine randomly selected nursing homes in the Czech Republic and participated in the Czech-Austrian Long-Term Care Research Project called DEMDATA. Information about medication administration was obtained from medical records. Cognitive impairment was evaluated by the Mini-Mental State Examination, and pain was measured by the Pain Assessment in Advanced Dementia. To measure anxiety, we used the Behavioral Pathology in Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale in residents with severe-to-moderate dementia and also the standardized questionnaire EuroQol in other residents. RESULTS: In all, 68% (95% CI 62-74) of residents with pain did not receive any analgesic medication and 31% (95% CI 25-38) of residents were administered some analgesics and continued to report pain. The lowest reported occurrence of pain, as well as the lowest prevalence of analgesic administration, was in residents with moderate-to-severe dementia. We found that an alarming percentage of residents in the nursing homes were not treated sufficiently CONCLUSION: This study indicates that treatment effects should be better monitored",10.2147/CIA.S188601

Protocol for a multicentre randomised control trial,Child; Female; Humans; Male; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Nails/injuries/surgery; Pain/etiology; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Surgical Wound Infection/prevention & control; Wound Healing; finger; nail bed; paediatric; randomised clinical trial,"INTRODUCTION: Trauma to the nail bed is the most common surgically treated paediatric hand injury. The majority of surgeons replace the nail plate after repairing the nail bed despite a lack of evidence to do so. Replacing the nail plate may be associated with increased postoperative infection. We will investigate the impact of replacing or discarding the nail plate on infection, cosmetic appearance, pain and subsequent healthcare use. The Nail bed INJury Analysis trial (NINJA) aims to answer the question of whether the nail plate should be replaced or discarded after surgical nail bed repair in children METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A two-arm parallel group open multicentre randomised control trial of replacing the nail plate or not, as part of a nail bed repair, will be undertaken in children presenting within 48 hours of a nail bed injury requiring surgical repair. The coprimary outcomes are: cosmetic appearance summary score at a minimum of 4 months and surgical site infection at around 7 days following surgery. Secondary outcomes are EuroQol EQ-5D-(Y); the pain intensity experienced at first dressing change; child/parent satisfaction with nail healing and healthcare resource use. We will recruit a minimum of 416 patients (208 in each group) over 3 years. Children and their parents/carers will be reviewed in clinic around 7 days after their operation and will be assessed for surgical site infection or other problems. The children, or depending on age, their parents/carers, will also be asked to complete a questionnaire and send in photos of their fingernail at a minimum of 4 months postsurgery to assess cosmetic appearance. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The South Central Research Ethics Committee approved this study on 4 June 2019 (18/SC/0024). A manuscript to a peer-reviewed journal will be submitted on completion of the trial as per National Institute for Health Research publication policy. The results of this trial will substantially inform clinical practice and provide evidence on whether the practice of replacing the nail plate should continue at the time of nail bed repair.

This study aimed to examine health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and health care access among patients engaging in methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) in Tuyen Quang, a mountainous province in Vietnam. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey with 241 patients conveniently recruited in two MMT clinics (Son Duong and Tuyen Quang). EuroQol-5 Dimensions - 5 levels (EQ-5D-5 L) and Visual analogue scale (VAS) were employed to measure HRQOL. Multivariate logistic and tobit regressions were used to determine the factors associated with HRQOL and health care utilization. RESULTS: The overall mean score of the EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS were 0.88 (SD = 0.20) and 81.8% (SD = 15.27%), respectively. Only 8.7% utilized inpatient services, and 14.9% used outpatient services. Being more highly educated, suffering acute diseases, and using health service within the last 12 months were associated with a decreased EQ-5D index. Individuals who were multiple substance abusers and those who recently had inpatient care were more likely to have a lower VAS. Older respondents, those taking their medications at the more impoverished clinic, substance abusers, and individuals who were struggling with anxiety/depression or their usual daily activities were more likely to use both inpatient and outpatient care. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we observed good HRQOL, but high prevalence of anxiety/depression and low rates of service utilization among MMT patients in Tuyen Quang province. To improve the outcomes of MMT services in mountainous areas, it is necessary to introduce personalized and integrative services models with counseling and interventions on multiple substance use",10.1186/s12955-017-0633-9
7158,Mobile Health Self-management Interventions for Patients With Heart Failure: A Pilot Study,Dyspnea; Heart Failure/therapy; Humans; Pilot Projects; Quality of Life; Self-Management; Telemedicine,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a multifaceted syndrome that requires self-management for adherence to treatment to control symptoms. Symptoms need to be monitored to prevent impending HF exacerbations. Few HF study authors have assessed efficacy of mobile health (mHealth) interventions particularly with virtual visits to evaluate outcomes such as symptoms and healthcare utilization OBJECTIVE: The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate the potential effect of mHealth self-management interventions on symptom status and health-related quality of life and describe health care utilization in patients with HF METHODS: This 3-month pilot study included 74 patients with HF and used a randomized 3-group repeated-measures design (enhanced usual care, mHealth, and mHealth plus [+] virtual visits). Surveys included the Heart Failure Symptom Survey, EuroQol, and a specialized phone application for patients to report weights and medications. RESULTS: The mHealth groups had an overall decrease in most symptom severity and frequency, particularly shortness of breath. Compared to enhanced usual care, both the mHealth+ and mHealth groups showed promise with medium effect sizes (range .55-.60) in relation to shortness of breath and a medium effect (.51) for lower extremity edema for the mHealth+ group. There was a trend toward improvement in health-related quality of life in both intervention groups at month 3. The mHealth+ group had fewer rehospitalizations. CONCLUSIONS: In general, both mHealth groups fared better on symptoms and health care utilization. Small to medium effect sizes on selected symptom outcomes warrant this study to be conducted in a fully powered study. Virtual visits may assist in symptom recognition and self-management",10.1097/JCN.0000000000000846

The purpose of the present study was to examine whether patients who made high-quality, informed, patient-centered (IPC) decisions had better health outcomes, higher satisfaction, and less decision regret compared with those who made lower-quality decisions. METHODS: A multisite, randomized study of 2 decision aids for patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis was utilized to collect data on decision-making and health outcomes at 2 time points: shortly after the initial surgical evaluation and about 6 months after treatment. We calculated the percentage of patients who made an IPC decision and examined the a priori hypotheses that IPC decisions would be associated with better health outcomes, satisfaction, and less regret at 6 months. Linear and logistic regression models were utilized to examine the relationships. RESULTS: The analytic sample included 854 patients with a mean age of 65 years (standard deviation, 9 years), of whom 58% were female, 93% were White non-Hispanic, 67% had knee (compared with hip) osteoarthritis, and 62% underwent operative treatment within 6 months of the initial evaluation. The majority of patients (68%) made IPC decisions. The IPC group had significantly larger gains in quality of life (mean difference in EuroQol-5 Dimension, 0.04; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.02 to 0.07; p < 0.001) compared with the non-IPC group. For knee patients, the IPC group also had significantly better Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Scores (mean difference, 4.9; 95% CI, 1.5 to 8.3; p = 0.004), higher satisfaction (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2 to 2.3; p = 0.003), much better pain relief (aOR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.3 to 3.5; p = 0.002), and were more likely to have no decision regret (aOR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.3 to 4.1; p = 0.003). For hip patients, IPC decisions were not associated with better Harris hip scores or satisfaction and were associated with more regret. CONCLUSIONS: Higher-quality decisions predicted small improvements in health outcomes, as well as greater satisfaction and less regret for patients with knee osteoarthritis, but not for patients with hip osteoarthritis.

3060,Depression and anxiety in individuals with axial spondyloarthritis and nonspecific low back pain who are interested in non-pharmacological therapy options: Cross-sectional study,"Anxiety/psychology/therapy; Axial Spondyloarthritis; Back Pain; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression/etiology/psychology/therapy; Female; Humans; Low Back Pain/therapy; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Spondylarthritis/drug therapy; Spondylitis, Ankylosing","Psychological burden, such as depression and anxiety, may be associated with axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and poor prognosis of nonspecific low back pain (NSLBP). Non-pharmacological therapy is a substantial part of the management of both illnesses. Our study describes the psychological outcomes in patients with axSpA and NSLBP who were actively looking for non-pharmacological therapy. A total of 60 participants (34 with axSpA and 26 with NSLBP) were included in this cross-sectional study. Anxiety and depression were examined using the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), respectively. The relationships between BAI and BDI-II and quality of life (EQ-5D), pain intensity (NRS pain), disease activity (AS disease activity score, ASDAS-CRP), and function (Bath AS Functional Index, BASFI) were determined. The intensity of anxiety and depression did not differ between patients with and without axSpA. In both, axSpA and NSLBP, BAI, and BDI-II scores were inversely correlated with EQ-5D, R = -0.268 (P ˂ .05) and R = -0.486 (P ˂ .0001), respectively. We found a variation in the relationship between pain intensity and psychological outcomes in NSLBP and axSpA. The pain intensity score was correlated with the BDI-II (R = 0.542, P = .001) and BAI (R = 0.489, P = .003) scores only in patients with axSpA. In patients with axSpA, BAI was inversely correlated with disease duration (R = -0.356, P = .039) and positively correlated with increased disease activity and poor function, ASDAS-CRP (R = 0.431, P = .012) and BASFI (R = 0.621, P ˂ .0001) scores. The ASDAS-CRP score was positively correlated with BDI-II (R = 0.562, P = .001), and both disease activity and female sex were identified as risk factors for poor BDI-II outcomes in axSpA patients according to multiple regression analysis. Experiences of anxiety and depression seem to be similar for patients with axSpA and NSLBP in this selected group of participants. However, pain intensity may influence psychological outcomes, mainly in patients with axSpA. Disease activity, impaired function, and female sex were risk factors for anxiety and depression in patients with axSpA",10.1097/MD.0000000000030866

We aimed to describe changes in anxiety and HRQoL in a high-risk Canadian cohort undergoing LDCT lung cancer screening. METHODS: 2537 subjects who had 2% or greater lung cancer risk over 6 years using a risk prediction tool were recruited from eight centres across Canada in the Pan-Canadian Early Detection of Lung Cancer Study (2008-2010). We compared HRQoL and anxiety levels before and after screening of 1237 participants with LDCT (excluding a subset of 1300 participants who also underwent autofluorescence bronchoscopy screening), as well as after investigations performed because of a positive screening examination. The 12-item short-form Physical and Mental Component Scales (SF-12), EQ-5D-3L scores and State Trait Anxiety Inventory-State anxiety were used at each assessment RESULTS: Overall, there were no clinically significant differences in HRQoL outcomes between baseline and each of the survey time points following initial screening. No mean change in anxiety in the overall cohort was noted following baseline LDCT, but more participants had clinically significant increase in anxiety versus decrease after baseline screening (increase >minimal clinically important difference (MCID) (n=180) vs decrease >MCID (n=50), p<0.001). This finding persisted but to a lesser degree at the 12 month time point (increase >MCID (n=146) vs decrease >MCID (n=87), p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: CT screening for lung cancer has no major overall impact on HRQoL among participants, although a minority of participants (number-needed-to-harm=7 after baseline screening and 18 at 1 year) demonstrated clinically significant increased anxiety levels TRIALREGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00751660; Results",10.1136/bmjopen-2018-024719

METHODS: We formulated hypotheses about the convergent validity between the instruments (examined by Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney, Kruskal Wallis and Spearman's correlation tests) and levels of agreement (assessed using intra class correlation (ICC) and modified Bland-Altman plots based on normalized Z EQ-5D-3 L and ASCOT utilities and OPQoL-Brief summary scores). RESULTS: The utilities/summary scores for 87 participants (aged 65-93 years) were moderately but positively correlated. Moderate convergent validity was evident for a number of instrument dimensions with the strongest relationship (r = 0.57) between 'enjoy life' (OPQoL-Brief) and 'social contact' (ASCOT). The overall ICC was 0.54 and Bland-Altman scatter plots showed 3-6% of normalized Z-scores were outside the 95% limits of agreement suggesting moderate agreement between all three instruments (agreement highest between the OPQoL-Brief and the ASCOT). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the OPQoL-Brief, the ASCOT and the EQ-5D_3L are suitable for measuring quality of life outcomes in community-dwelling populations of older people. Given the different constructs underpinning these instruments, we recommend that choice of instrument should be guided by the context in which the instruments are being applied. Currently, the OPQoL-Brief is not suitable for use in cost-utility analyses as it is not preference-based. Given their different perspectives, we recommend that both the ASCOT and the EQ-5D are applied simultaneously to capture broader aspects of quality of life and health status within cost-utility analyses within the aged care sector. Future research directed towards the development of a new single preference-based instrument that incorporates both health status and broader aspects of quality of life within quality adjusted life year calculations for older people would be beneficial",10.1186/s12955-015-0357-7

MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective study was conducted on 126 RSA between 2009 and 2011, in which 4 fractures were identified that were compared with a control group of 40 patients. An analysis was performed on the variables related to the surgical technique, functional results, and quality of life (Constant scale, EQ-5D) RESULTS: The fracture incidence was 3.28% with a mean age of 74.7 years. The mean time until diagnosis was 11.9 months. The preoperative Constant score in the control group was 37.3%, and 34.7% in the fracture group (P>.05); postoperative Constant score: 81.2 and 66.5%, respectively (P>.001). Forward elevation and abduction in fracture patients decreased by 39° (P=.02), and 34° (P=.057) respectively. The perceived quality of life (EQ-VAS) was lower in the fracture group (60 vs. 76) (P=.002). There were no instability cases, and no revision surgery was required. The union rate was 50% after a mean follow-up 39.6 months CONCLUSIONS: Scapular fracture after RSA is a rare complication. Despite its presence, the functional outcomes and quality of life of these patients are higher than preoperatively; however, they are lower than that obtained in patients with RSA without this complication. More prospective studies are needed to define guidelines for therapeutic action against this complication",10.1016/j.recot.2015.01.003
15320,Loss and psychosocial factors as determinants of quality of life in a cohort of earthquake survivors,"Age Factors; Aged; Armenia/epidemiology; Cohort Studies; Disasters; Earthquakes; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life/psychology; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic/epidemiology/psychology; Survivors/psychology","BACKGROUND: Despite the existing evidence of a long lasting effect of disaster related experiences on physical and psychological health, few studies have evaluated long-term quality of life (QOL) outcomes of disaster survivors and the factors associated with such outcomes. METHODS: 23 years after the 1988 Spitak earthquake in Armenia, the associations of demographic characteristics, trauma exposure and psychosocial variables on QOL were explored among a cohort of 725 exposed individuals. The EQ-5D-5 L instrument was applied to measure QOL of participants. Multivariate linear and ordinal logistic regressions were applied to evaluate the determinants of QOL and its underlying five domains (mobility, self-care, usual activity, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression). RESULTS: Older age, current depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety symptoms were negatively associated with QOL. Additionally, those with severe losses (who did not receive any financial/material aid) had significantly poorer QOL outcomes, with higher odds of mobility difficulties (OR = 1.86, p < 0.05), self-care difficulties (OR = 2.85, p < 0.05), and mood problems (OR = 2.69, p < 0.05). However, those with severe earthquake related losses who received financial/material aid reported less self-care difficulties (OR = 0.21, p < 0.05) usual activity difficulties (OR = 0.40, p < 0.05), and mood problems (OR = 0.44, p < 0.05). Finally, each unit increase in current social support score was found to be significantly associated with a better QOL outcome and better self-reported outcomes across all underlying domains of QOL. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that earthquake related loss and concurrent psychopathology symptoms can have adverse impact on the QOL of survivors. They also indicate that well-targeted post-disaster financial/material aid and social support should be considered as means for improving the long-term QOL outcomes of disaster survivors",10.1186/s12955-015-0209-5
10870,[Health inequality measurement in Korea using EuroQol-5 Dimension valuation weights],Adult; Aged; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Income; Korea; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires,"OBJECTIVES: Despite various government initiatives, including the expansion of national health insurance coverage, health inequality has been a key health policy issue in South Korea during the past decade. This study describes and compares the extent of the total health inequality and the income-related health inequality over time among Korean adults. METHODS: This study employs the 1998, 2001 and 2005 Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (KNHANESs). The self-assessed health (SAH) ordinal responses, measured on a five-point scale, rescaled to cardinal values to measure the health inequalities with using interval regression. The boundaries of each threshold for the interval regression analysis were obtained from the empirical distribution of the EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) valuation weights estimated from the 2005 KNHANES The final model predicting the individuals' health status included age, gender, educational attainment, occupation, income, and the regional prosperity index The concentration index was used to measure and analyze the health inequality RESULTS: The KNHANES data showed an unequal distribution of the total health inequality in favor of the higher income groups, and this is getting worse over time (0.0327 in 1998, 0.0393 in 2001 and 0.0924 in 2005). The income-related health inequality in 2005 was 0.0278, indicating that 30.1% of the total health inequality can be attributed to income. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate there are health inequalities across the sociodemographic and income groups despite the recent government's efforts. Further research is warranted to investigate what potential policy actions are necessary to decrease the health inequality in Korea",10.3961/jpmph.2008.41.3.165

The clinical and radiological outcomes of trochleoplasty surgery in trochlear dysplasia have been well reported. There is a paucity in literature regarding the correlation between trochleoplasty and quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study is to measure the improvement in QoL, in patients with severe trochlear dysplasia and recurrent patellar instability following trochleoplasty. METHODS: Between 2013 and 2019, 51 trochleoplasty cases were performed in 48 patients. They were identified from our prospectively kept database. All operations were performed by a fellowship trained consultant sports knee surgeon. Functional outcomes and QoL scores were assessed using Kujala, IKDC and EQ-5D index. Objective outcomes were obtained following each patient's latest follow-up assessment. RESULTS: The mean age at operation was 22y (SD ± 4.7, range 14-37y) and the mean follow-up period was 21.6 months (SD ± 15.2, range 12-60 months). The mean Kujala score improved from 58.1 (SD 14.9) to 77.9 (SD 17.3) at latest follow-up (p < 0.001). The mean IKDC score improved from 40.5 (SD 14.2) to 69.5 (SD 22.8) at latest follow up (p < 0.001). The mean EQ-5D index also improved from 0.593 (SD 0.257) to 0.824 (SD 0.189) at latest follow-up (p = 0.003). A higher Body Mass Index (BMI; >30 kg/m(2)) was associated with inferior outcomes. CONCLUSION: Trochleoplasty is an effective surgical technique which improves the QoL in patients suffering from patellar instability secondary to severe trochlear dysplasia. BMI can be used to predict post-operative outcomes",10.1016/j.knee.2022.06.003

However, unlike life expectancy for which age- and sex-dependent national life tables are available, no general population norms exist to use as a benchmark against which to compare observed or modeled projections of QALYs in sub-populations or patients. We developed a 2-state Markov model to generate QALY population norms for the USA, UK, China and Australia. Annual age- and sex-specific probabilities of all-cause mortality were taken from life tables combined with general population country-specific age- and sex-specific health state utilities for the EQ-5D-3L (all countries); and SF-6D (Australia) multi-attribute utility instruments (MAUI). To validate our QALY benchmark model we found that the model closely predicted population life expectancies. Using EQ-5D-3L, undiscounted QALYs for males/females aged 18 years ranged 54.62/58.90 (USA), 55.55/60.21 (China), 57.11/60.16 (Australia), and 58.01/61.43 (UK) years SF-6D benchmark QALYs for Australia were consistently lower than those generated from the EQ-5D-3L. The gap in undiscounted QALYs between the UK (highest) and the USA (lowest) was 2.53 QALYs in women and 3.39 QALYs in men aged 18 years. Our model's QALY population norms can be used for internal validation of future health economic models for the country-specific value sets for the instruments that we adopted, and when quantifying burden of disease in terms of QALYs lost due to illness compared to the general population. We have created a publicly available repository to continuously include QALY benchmarks that use country-specific value sets for other MAUIs and life expectancies",10.1002/hec.4281
1059,Handling Data Quality Issues to Estimate the Spanish EQ-5D-5L Value Set Using a Hybrid Interval Regression Approach,"Choice Behavior; Data Accuracy; Health Status; Humans; Language; Models, Theoretical; Quality of Life; Regression Analysis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Technology Assessment, Biomedical/methods; economic; health status index; life valuation; quality of life","BACKGROUND: The Spanish five-level EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L) valuation study was the first to use the EuroQol Valuation Technology protocol, including composite time trade-off (C-TTO) and discrete choice experiments (DCE). In this study, its investigators noticed that some interviewers did not fully explain the C-TTO task to respondents. Evidence from a follow-up study in 2014 confirmed that when interviewers followed the protocol, the distribution of C-TTO responses widened. OBJECTIVES: To handle the data quality issues in the C-TTO responses by estimating a hybrid interval regression model to produce a Spanish EQ-5D-5L value set. METHODS: Four different models were tested. Model 0 integrated C-TTO and DCE responses in a hybrid model and models 1 to 3 altered the interpretation of the C-TTO responses: model 1 allowed for censoring of the C-TTO responses, whereas model 2 incorporated interval responses and model 3 included the interviewer-specific protocol violations. For external validation, the predictions of the four models were compared with those of the follow-up study using the Lin's concordance correlation coefficient RESULTS: This stepwise approach to modeling C-TTO and DCE responses improved the concordance between the valuation and follow-up studies (concordance correlation coefficient: 0.948 [model 0], 0.958 [model 1], 0.952 [model 2], and 0.989 [model 3]). We recommend the estimates from model 3, because its hybrid interval regression model addresses the data quality issues found in the valuation study CONCLUSIONS: Protocol violations may occur in any valuation study; handling them in the analysis can improve external validity. The resulting EQ-5D-5L value set (model 3) can be applied to inform Spanish health technology assessments",10.1016/j.jval.2017.10.023

Psychological care is a common component of CR as symptoms of depression and/or anxiety are more prevalent in this population, however evidence for the cost-effectiveness of current interventions is limited Metacognitive therapy (MCT), is a recent treatment development that is effective in treating anxiety and depression in mental health settings and is being evaluated in CR patients. This protocol describes the planned approach to the economic evaluation of MCT for CR patients. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The economic evaluation work will consist of a within-trial analysis and an economic model The PATHWAY Group MCT study has been prospectively designed to collect comprehensive self-reported resource use and health outcome data, including the EQ-5D, within a randomised controlled trial study design (UK Clinical Trials Gateway). A within-trial economic evaluation and economic model will compare the cost-effectiveness of MCT plus usual care (UC) to UC, from a health and social care perspective in the UK. The within-trial analysis will use intention-to-treat and estimate total costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for the trial follow-up. Single imputation will be used to impute missing baseline variables Multiple imputation will be used to impute values missing at follow-up. Items of resource use will be multiplied by published national healthcare costs Regression analysis will be used to estimate net costs and net QALYs and these estimates will be bootstrapped to generate 10 000 net pairs of costs and QALYs to inform the probability of cost-effectiveness. A decision analytical economic model will be developed to synthesise trial data with the published literature over a longer time frame. Sensitivity analysis will explore uncertainty. Guidance of the methods for economic models will be followed and dissemination will adhere to reporting guidelines. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The economic evaluation includes a within-trial analysis. The trial which included the collection of this data was reviewed and approved by Ethics. Ethics approval was obtained by the Preston Research Ethics Committee (project ID 156862). The modelling analysis is not applicable for Ethics as it will use data from the trial (secondary analysis) and the published literature. Results of the main trial and economic evaluation will be published in the peer-reviewed National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) journals library (Programme Grants for Applied Research), submitted to a peer-reviewed journal and presented at appropriate conferences.

Few studies have assessed the effect of leg pain on health care use and quality of life. METHODS: Prospective cohort study of 1,581 UK LBP primary care consulters. Back pain, employment, health care utilisation, and quality of life (EQ-5D) data were collected at baseline, 6 and 12 months. At baseline, patients were classified as reporting (1) LBP only, (2) LBP and leg pain above the knee only (LBP + AK) or (3) LBP and leg pain extending below the knee (LBP + BK). RESULTS: Self-reported leg pain was common; at baseline 645 (41 %) reported LBP only, 392 (25 %) reported LBP + AK and 544 (34 %) reported LBP + BK. Patients with LBP + BK, compared to those with LBP only, were significantly more likely to be unemployed, take time off work, consult their family doctor, receive physical therapy, or be referred to other health care practitioners. There were statistically significant decrements in EQ-5D scores for LBP + AK compared to LBP only, and for LBP + BK compared to LBP + AK (p ≤ 0.05 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with self-reported leg pain below the knee utilise more health care are more likely to be unemployed and have poorer quality of life than those with LBP only 12 months following primary care consultation. The presence of leg pain warrants early identification in primary care to explore if targeted interventions can reduce the impact and consequences of leg pain",10.1007/s00586-014-3355-2

Method to assess cost-effectiveness using registry data,Aged; Cataract Extraction/economics; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Disability Evaluation; Female; Health Care Costs; Health Services Research; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Registries; Sickness Impact Profile; Surveys and Questionnaires; Sweden; Visual Acuity,"To develop a method to estimate the cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained with cataract surgery using large patient registries.Four centers in Sweden. Five hundred patients scheduled for cataract extraction in 1 eye at 1 of 4 centers in Sweden during March 1999 were asked to complete the EQ-5D, a preference-based quality-of-life instrument, and the Catquest, a disease-specific disability measure, before surgery. Multiple regression analysis was used to study the correlation between utility and visual acuity and/or disability and utility and QALY gain through the intervention estimated. Visual acuity and Catquest scores were available for 484 patients. The mean age was 76.1 years; the mean logMAR visual acuity was 0.59 in the surgical eye and 0.26 in the other eye The mean Catquest disability score was 13.79 and the mean utility, 0.74 Utilities correlated significantly with visual acuity and disability scores, and the correlations remained significant when both were included in a regression model, indicating that the 2 measure different concepts. The hypothetical cost per QALY gained (discounted at 3%) was estimated at 45000 SKr (4500 US dollars) using the Swedish Cataract Registry. The results indicate that visual acuity and visual disability significantly affect utilities controlled for age and ophthalmic comorbidity. It is thus possible to use data on visual acuity and disability in large registries to estimate the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery and to compare the cost per QALY gained with other health care interventions",10.1016/s0886-3350(02)01220-8

In this study, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patient-caregiver dyads during the period of chemotherapy was assessed. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Two hundred twenty-two cancer patient-caregiver dyads were enrolled in the study, which was conducted from October 2008 to March 2009. HRQoL was evaluated with EQ-5D. RESULTS: The mean age of the sample was 57.4 and 48.9 for patients and caregivers, respectively. The EQ-5D descriptive system indicates that female patients more frequently experience anxiety and depression than male patients. Male and higher-education caregivers had higher VAS scores, while demographic factors did not seem to influence patients' HRQoL Anxiety and depression of caregivers were correlated with patients' problems in self-care and usual activities. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of life is highly influenced during the period of chemotherapy for both patients and caregivers and is often under reported. Interventions that can improve HRQoL, especially in the domain of mental health for both cancer patients and their caregivers, need to be implemented",10.1100/2012/135283

Economic evaluation can be a helpful tool to inform resource allocation in publicly financed systems. Such evaluations frequently use health-related outcome measures. However, in areas such as care of older people, improving health outcomes is not necessarily the main focus of care interventions and broader outcome measures, including outcomes for those providing informal care, may be preferred when evaluating such interventions. This paper validates a recently introduced well-being measure, the ICECAP-O, in a population of informal carers for people with dementia from eight European countries. METHODS: Convergent and discriminant validity tests were performed to validate the ICECAP-O using data obtained in a sample of 451 respondents from Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and the UK. These respondents completed a number of standardized questionnaires within the framework of the Actifcare project. RESULTS: The ICECAP-O performed well among informal carers, in terms of both convergent and discriminant validity. In the multivariate analysis, it was found to be significantly associated with the age of the person with dementia, EQ-5D-5L health problem index of the person with dementia, carer-patient relationship, care recipient CDR, carer LSNS Score, the PAI score, and Perseverance Time. CONCLUSION: The ICECAP-O appears to be a valid measure of well-being in informal carers for people with dementia. The ICECAP-O may therefore be useful as an outcome measure in economic evaluations of interventions aimed at such informal carers, when these aim to improve well-being beyond health",10.1007/s11136-019-02317-3

DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey with an age-matched and sex-matched housed comparison group. SETTING: Hostels, day centres and soup runs in London and Birmingham, England. PARTICIPANTS: Homeless participants were either sleeping rough or living in hostels and had a history of sleeping rough. The comparison group was drawn from the Health Survey for England. The study included 1336 homeless and 13 360 housed participants. OUTCOME MEASURES: Chronic diseases were self-reported asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), epilepsy, heart problems, stroke and diabetes Health-related quality of life was measured using EQ-5D-3L. RESULTS: Housed participants in more deprived neighbourhoods were more likely to report disease Homeless participants were substantially more likely than housed participants in the most deprived quintile to report all diseases except diabetes (which had similar prevalence in homeless participants and the most deprived housed group) For example, the prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was 1.1% (95% CI 0.7% to 1.6%) in the least deprived housed quintile; 2.0% (95% CI 1.5% to 2.6%) in the most deprived housed quintile; and 14.0% (95% CI 12.2% to 16.0%) in the homeless group. Social gradients were also seen for problems in each EQ-5D-3L domain in the housed population, but homeless participants had similar likelihood of reporting problems as the most deprived housed group. The exception was problems related to anxiety, which were substantially more common in homeless people than any of the housed groups. CONCLUSIONS: While differences in health between housed socioeconomic groups can be described as a 'slope', differences in health between housed and homeless people are better understood as a 'cliff'",10.1136/bmjopen-2018-025192
1314,DIFFERENTIATION OF HEALTH-RELATED QUALITY OF LIFE OUTCOMES BETWEEN FIVE DISEASE AREAS: RESULTS FROM AN INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF PATIENTS,"Adult; Arthritis, Rheumatoid/psychology; Breast Neoplasms/psychology; Female; Health Status; Health Surveys; Humans; Internationality; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis/psychology; Quality of Life; Rare Diseases/psychology; EQ-5D-5L; Health Technology Assessment; Patient preferences; QoL utilities; Rare diseases","OBJECTIVES: Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) data generated by generic, preference-based instruments (i.e., EQ-5D) are highly demanded in health policy decision making, because they allow for direct comparisons of HRQoL outcomes between disease areas. We aimed to quantify HRQoL outcomes in breast cancer (BC), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), multiple sclerosis (MS), rare cancers (RC), and rare disease (RD) patients and understand the patterns that differentiate HRQoL outcomes between these disease areas, and more specifically between rare and more common disease population groups. METHODS: An international, Web survey of patients measured HRQoL (EQ-5D-5L), self-perceived health (EQ-5D-5L Visual Analogue Scale), and additional QoL dimensions, such as patient disability level RESULTS: We received 675 completed responses. Average utility loss was 53.5 percent, 32.5 percent, and 33.3 percent for RD, RA, and MS patients, respectively, in contrast to 18.6 percent for BC and RC patients. Statistically significant differences (p < .05) were observed between disease groups in all EQ-5D-5L domain outcomes, apart from that of ""Anxiety/Depression."" Severe and/or extreme problems were reported in performing usual activities for RD and RC (34 percent and 13 percent of overall problems reported respectively), mobility for MS (18 percent), pain/discomfort for RA (13 percent), and anxiety/depression for BC (7 percent) patients. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated significant differences in the dimensions that drive HRQoL outcomes between rare and more common diseases and showcased that the same EQ-5D utility may reflect very different severities depending on the patient population under investigation. Future research should examine whether outcomes in other, critical HRQoL domains not included in generic measures also highlight significant differences across disease areas",10.1017/S0266462318000557

METHODS: A total of 40 patients (mean age 35+/-12 years), treated for a focal cartilage lesion in the knee were included in this study. Test-retest data were collected with an intermediate period of 2 days. Patients were asked to complete the Dutch KOOS and complementary questionnaires [short form-36 (SF-36), Lysholm, EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D)] to evaluate the clinimetric properties of the KOOS in terms of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), reliability [intra-class-correlation (ICC) and Bland and Altman plots], construct validity (Spearman's rank correlation), floor and ceiling effects and responsiveness. RESULTS: The Cronbach's alpha of the KOOS subdomains and total score ranged from 0.74 to 0.96. The overall ICC of the KOOS was 0.97 while the subscales ranged from 0.87 to 0.95. The Bland and Altman plots showed a small individual variance between the two assessments in time Spearman's rank correlations between the subscales of the KOOS and representative subscales of the SF-36, Lysholm and EQ-5D were high to moderate ranging from 0.43 to 0.70. We observed no floor effect while the largest observed ceiling effect was 10.3%. The responsiveness was moderate to large with the effect size ranging from 0.70 to 1.32 and the standardized response mean 0.61 to 0.87. CONCLUSION: This study illustrates the validity and reliability of the KOOS in measuring the clinical condition of patients after treatment of focal cartilage lesions. This study provides a basis for the use of the KOOS for future clinical research in cartilage repair",10.1016/j.joca.2009.04.019
